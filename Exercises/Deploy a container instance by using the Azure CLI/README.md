# Deploy a container instance by using the Azure CLI

In this exercise you learn how to perform the following actions:

- Create a resource group for the container
- Create a container
- Verify the container is running

Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free trial at <https://azure.com/free>

## Sign-in to Azure and create the resource group

1. Sign-in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and open the Cloud Shell.

   ![The location of Cloud Shell launch button.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/create-run-container-images-azure-container-instances/media/cloud-shell-menu.png)

1. When the shell opens be sure to select the Bash environment.

1. Create a new resource group with the name az204-aci-rg so that it's easier to clean up these resources when you're finished with the module. Replace `<myLocation>` with a region near you.

   ```sh
   az group create --name az204-aci-rg --location <myLocation>
   ```

## Create a container

You create a container by providing a name, a Docker image, and an Azure resource group to the `az container create` command. You expose the container to the Internet by specifying a DNS name label.

1. Create a DNS name to expose your container to the Internet. Your DNS name must be unique. Run this command from Cloud Shell to create a variable that holds a unique name.

   ```sh
   DNS_NAME_LABEL=aci-example-$RANDOM
   ```

1. Run the following `az container create` command to start a container instance. Be sure to replace the `<myLocation>` with the region you specified earlier. It takes a few minutes for the operation to complete.

   ```sh
   az container create --resource-group az204-aci-rg
       --name mycontainer
       --image mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld
       --ports 80 --os-type Linux --cpu 1 --memory 1 \
       --dns-name-label $DNS_NAME_LABEL --location <myLocation>
   ```

   In the previous command, `$DNS_NAME_LABEL` specifies your DNS name. The image name, `mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld`, refers to a Docker image that runs a basic Node.js web application.

## Verify the container is running

1. When the `az container create` command completes, run az container show to check its status.

   ```sh
   az container show --resource-group az204-aci-rg
       --name mycontainer
       --query "{FQDN:ipAddress.fqdn,ProvisioningState:provisioningState}"
       --out table
   ```

   You see your container's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) and its provisioning state. Here's an example.

   ```txt
   FQDN                                    ProvisioningState
   --------------------------------------  -------------------
   aci-wt.eastus.azurecontainer.io         Succeeded
   ```

   :information_source: If your container is in the **Creating** state, wait a few moments and run the command again until you see the **Succeeded** state.

1. From a browser, navigate to your container's FQDN to see it running. You may get a warning that the site isn't safe.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use the `az group delete` command to remove the resource group, the container registry, and the container images stored there.

```sh
az group delete --name az204-aci-rg --no-wait
```
