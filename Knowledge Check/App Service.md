# App Service

md: How App Service Plans are charged?

- Shared and Free
- Dedicated
- Isolated

<!-- Shared: CPU quota; Dedicated: per VM instance; Isolated: number of isolated workers -->

---

md: Describe fornt ends and workers in App Service? What is their networking behavior in different App Service Plans?

<!-- Front ends: Handle incoming HTTP(S) requests; Workers: host customer workload. Free and Shared: multi-tenant (shared) workers. Basic+ use dedicated workers. Standard runs on the same worker. -->

---

md: Which App Service Plan provides maximum scale out capabilities?

<!-- Isolated -->

---

md: What you must know when it comes to App Service Plan charging?

<!-- Having 0 apps will still incur charges -->

---

md: Deployment slots, diagnostic logs, perforing backups, apps in the same App Service plan: how they behave together?

<!-- Run on the same VM instances -->

---

md: When to isolate an app into a new App Service Plan?

<!-- Resource intensive apps, scaling app independently, need different geographical region -->

---

md: How to move an App Service Plan? What are the prerequisites and requirenments?

<!-- Source plan and destination plan must be in the same resource group, geographical region, same OS type, and supports the currently used features. -->

---

md: Describe different scaling methods. What plans do they require? How they behave? When to choose one over the other?

- Manual
- Autoscale
- Automatic scale

<!-- Manual: Basic+. Predictable one-off events; Autoscale: Standard+. Predictable periodic events or based on resource; Automatic scaling: PremiumV2+. Like Autoscale, but with pre-warmed instances. Use to avoid cold boots. -->

---

md: What are the differences between horizontal and vertical scaling?

<!-- Horizontal: scale out/in - adding VM instances; Vertical: scale up/down - changing plan -->

---

md: How to setup a scaling rule?

<!-- Switch to appropriate scaling plan; Activate autoscaling from web app; Create scaling rule; Set scaling condition -->

---

md: What is "flapping"?

<!-- a loop condition where a scale event triggers its opposite in a series of alternating events. -->

---

md: If you want to use `--is-linux`, what requirenments and limitations there are?

---

md: What are staging environments and what are the prerequisites to use them?

<!-- Deployment slots. Standard+ plan -->

---

md: Which settings get swapped in deployment slots and which don't? Examples?

<!-- Swapped: define the application's behavior; Not Swapped: define the application's environment and security -->

---

md: How to enable settings swapping in deployment slots?

<!-- WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_PRESERVE_DEFAULT_STICKY_SLOT_SETTINGS=false -->

---

md: What are best practices when using deployment slots? What are prerequisites?

<!-- Standard+ plan. Deploy to staging, then swap slots to warm up instances and eliminate downtime. -->

---

md: How to define custom deployment?

<!-- .deployment file; command and (optional) project settings -->

---

md: How to route traffic to different deployment slots manually? What happens when routing is automatic?

<!-- `x-ms-routing-name=`: `self` for production slot, `staging` for staging slot; Automatically all traffic is set to production -->

---

md: How App Settings works?

<!-- Overrides appsettings.json; Triggers a restart on change -->

---

md: What is "Always On"? When is needed? What are prerequisites to enable it?

<!-- Billed separately. Linux: Standard+ plan, it's on by default, maps to /home, /home/LogFiles is not affected by this setting, it's afected by logging being enabled, Blobs are read-only, higher latency for Storage -->

---

md: What you need to know if you want to use Azure Storage? What should you avoid?

<!-- Azure Files (RW) and Blobs (R for Linux) are supported. Not included in backups. For Linux there is higher latency compared to custom images; Don't mount to /home directly. Billed separately. Don't use for local databases or locked files -->
