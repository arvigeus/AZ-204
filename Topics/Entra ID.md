# [Microsoft Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/)

Implements [OAuth 2.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-protocols) authorization protocol, allowing third-party apps to access web-hosted resources on behalf of users. These resources have a unique _application ID URI_.

## Use case: App Service web app accessing Microsoft Graph API (or other service)

- For multi-tenant applications, an _application service principal_ is utilized to grant permissions. This enables the app to access Microsoft Graph API resources across multiple tenants without relying on a specific user identity.
- For single-tenant scenarios where the app only needs to access resources within a specific tenant, a _Managed Identity_ could be more appropriate.
- When the app needs to perform actions specific to an individual user (_on behalf of the user_), delegated permissions are used, requiring user authentication and consent.
- If the permissions required by the application can change dynamically based on runtime conditions, leveraging _Entra ID roles and policies_ would be more suitable.
- For short-lived operations that don't require persistent permissions, _token-based or key-based temporary access methods_ could be more fitting.

## Application Registration

All applications _must [register with Entra ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad?tabs=workforce-tenant)_ to delegate identity and access management: `Portal > app > 'Authentication' > 'Add identity provider' > set provider to Microsoft > 'Add'`. This creates an application object and a globally unique ID (app/client ID).

- **Application Object**: Resides in the Entra ID tenant where the app is registered. It serves as the _global representation_ of your application for use across all tenants. This object has:

  - A 1:1 relationship with the Software Application.
  - A 1:N relationship with _Service Principal Objects_, meaning one Application Object can have multiple corresponding _Service Principal Objects_.

- **[Service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/app-objects-and-service-principals?tabs=browser) Objects**: These are _local representations_ within each tenant (use **Enterprise applications** page in the Azure portal to manage). They are derived from the Application Object and come in three types:
  - **Application**: Created when an app gains resource access permissions.
  - **Managed Identity**: Automatically created when enabled. It grants access but is not directly modifiable.
  - **Legacy**: For apps created before modern registration methods, restricted to the tenant where created.

Changes to your application object also affect its service principals in the home tenant only. Deleting the application also deletes its home tenant service principal, but restoring that application object won't recover its service principals.

List service principals associated with an app: `az ad sp list --filter "appId eq '{AppId}'"`

To [protect an API in Azure API Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-protect-backend-with-aad), register both the backend API and web app, configure permissions to allow the web app to call the backend API (`az ad app permission add --id <WebApp-Application-Id> --api <Backend-API-Application-Id> --api-permissions <Permission-Id>=Scope`), and enable OAuth 2.0 user authorization along with adding the `validate-jwt` policy for token validation.

- `<Permission-Id>=Scope`: Delegated permissions
- `<Permission-Id>=Role`: Application permissions

## [Permissions (Scopes)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/permissions-consent-overview)

The app specifies required permissions using the `scope` query parameter, which defines the resource type. If unspecified, the default resource is Microsoft Graph. For instance, `scope=User.Read` is the same as `https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`.

| Permission types | Delegated permissions                                                    | Application permissions                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Access context   | Get access on behalf of a user (a signed-in user is present)             | Get access without a user (signed-in user) |
| Types of apps    | Web / Mobile / single-page app (SPA)                                     | Web / Daemon / Background services         |
| Other names      | Scopes / OAuth2 permission scopes                                        | App / App-only permissions roles           |
| Who can consent  | - Users can consent for their data<br>- Admins can consent for all users | Only admin can consent                     |
| Consent methods  | Static or Dynamic                                                        | Static ONLY                                |

`az ad app permission add --id {appId} --api {apiID} --api-permissions {permissionId}={Scope,Role}`

- Scope: Defines **what the application is allowed to do** on behalf of a user.
- Role: Defines more privileged **operations that the application can perform**, often without a user

### [Consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/user-admin-consent-overview)

- **Static user consent**: Requires all permissions to be specified in the Azure portal during app registration. Users or admins are prompted for consent if not previously granted. Issues: requires long lists of permissions and knowing all resources in advance.
- **Incremental (Dynamic) user consent**: Allows permissions to be requested gradually. Scopes can be specified during runtime without predefinition in Azure portal.
- **Admin consent**: needed for high-privilege permissions. Admins authorize apps to access privileged data. Requires static permissions registration. `az ad app permission admin-consent`

Requesting individual user consent:

```http
GET https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444
&response_type=code
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&response_mode=query
&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fcalendars.read%20https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fmail.send
&state=12345
```

## [Conditional Access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) (Premium P1 tier)

- Prompt additional verification (e.g., second password or fingerprint) when users sign in
- Using a middle tier to solve a "challenge" presented by API
- [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-licensing) (**all Microsoft 365 plans**). When [Security Defaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/security-defaults) is enabled, MFA is activated for **all users**. To apply MFA to specific users only, _disable Security Defaults_.
- Risk-based policies (require Entra ID Identity Protection - **Premium P2** tier)
- Device restrictions (enrolled in Microsoft's Intune service)
- Certain physical locations or IP ranges

When Conditional Access licenses expire, policies stay active but can't be updated.

Apps don't need to be changed, unless they need silent or indirect services access, or on-behalf-of flow.

- **Public client applications**: User-facing apps without the ability to securely store secrets. They interact with web APIs on the user's behalf.
- **Confidential client applications**: Server-based apps and daemons that can securely handle secrets. Each instance maintains a unique configuration, including identifiers and secrets.

### Working with MSAL

When building web apps or public client apps that require a broker, ensure to set the `redirectUri`. This URL is used by the identity provider to return security tokens to your application.

Integrating Entra ID authentication into an ASP.NET Core application:

```cs
builder.Services.AddAuthentication(OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)
  .AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApp(builder.Configuration.GetSection("AzureAd"));

builder.Services.AddRazorPages()
  .AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

// OpenIdConnectDefaults.AuthenticationScheme: Enables OpenID Connect authentication, best for OAuth 2.0 and Single Sign-On (SSO).
// JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme: Used for authenticating APIs via JSON Web Tokens (JWT), suitable for stateless and scalable APIs.
// CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme: Employs cookies for session-based authentication, optimal for traditional web apps that manage user sessions server-side.
// Custom Authentication Scheme: Allows for custom string identifiers for authentication middleware, ideal for specialized or unique authentication scenarios.
```

```cs
// Sign in users in the Microsoft Azure public cloud using their work and school accounts or personal Microsoft accounts.
IPublicClientApplication app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId).Build();

// Confidential application that handles tokens from Microsoft Azure users using a shared client secret for identification.
// Example: A daemon application that does not interact with the user and acts on its own behalf, like a service accessing Graph API
IConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
    .WithRedirectUri(redirectUri )
    .Build();
```

Console.WriteLine($"Token: {result.AccessToken}");
```

## [Application manifest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/reference-app-manifest)

An Entra ID application manifest configures an app's identity and attributes, facilitating OAuth authorization and user consent. It serves as a mechanism for updating the application object in the Microsoft identity platform.

- `signInAudience`:

  - `AzureADMyOrg` - Users with a Microsoft work or school account in my organization's Microsoft Entra tenant (for example, single tenant)
  - `AzureADMultipleOrgs` - Users with a Microsoft work or school account in any organization's Microsoft Entra tenant (for example, multi-tenant)
  - `AzureADandPersonalMicrosoftAccount` - Users with a personal Microsoft account, or a work or school account in any organization's Microsoft Entra tenant
  - `PersonalMicrosoftAccount` - Personal accounts that are used to sign in to services like Xbox and Skype.

- `groupMembershipClaims`: (_Tenant-specific_) Groups claim issued in access token that the app expects. Groups persist even after the associated app is removed.

  - "None"
  - "SecurityGroup" (will include security groups and Entra ID roles)
  - "ApplicationGroup" (this option includes only groups that are assigned to the application)
  - "DirectoryRole" (gets the Entra ID directory roles the user is a member of)
  - "All" (this will get all of the security groups, distribution groups, and Entra ID directory roles that the signed-in user is a member of).

- [`appRoles`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps) (_Application-specific_): Collection of roles that an app may declare. Defined in the app registration, and will get removed with it. Correspond to `Role` in `--api-permissions`

  ```jsonc
  "appRoles": [{
      "allowedMemberTypes": [ "User" ],
      "value": "ReadOnly" // expected value of the roles claim in the token, which must match the string in the application's code without spaces.
  }]
  ```

- `oauth2Permissions`: Specifies the collection of OAuth 2.0 permission scopes that the web API (resource) app exposes to client apps. Correspond to `Scope` in `--api-permissions`.

- `oauth2AllowImplicitFlow` - If the web app can request implicit flow access tokens (`oauth2AllowIdTokenImplicitFlow` for ID tokens). ⭐: SPAs, when using Implicit Grant Flow.

## ASP.NET Core Authorization: Working with Roles, Claims, and Policies

- [**Policies**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/policies?view=aspnetcore-3.1): A policy is a function that can look at a user's identity and decide whether they are authorized to perform a given action.
- [**Roles**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/roles?view=aspnetcore-3.1): A role represents a group of users that have certain privileges as defined by the role.
- [**Claims**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/claims?view=aspnetcore-3.1): A claim is a name-value pair that represents what the subject is, not what the subject can do.

```cs
// Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // Define policies
    services.AddAuthorization(options =>
    {
        options.AddPolicy("ClientsOnly", policy =>
        {
            policy.RequireAuthenticatedUser(); // Requires the user to be authenticated
            policy.RequireRoles("PrivateClient", "CorporateClient"); // Requires ANY of these listed roles
            policy.RequireClaim("SubscriptionTier", "free", "basic", "premium"); // Requires ANY of the values for SubscriptionTier
        });
        options.AddPolicy("FreeloadersOnly", policy =>
        {
            policy.RequireAuthenticatedUser();
            policy.RequireRole("PrivateClient");
            policy.RequireClaim("SubscriptionTier", "free");
        });
        options.AddPolicy("EmployeeOnly", policy => policy.RequireClaim("EmployeeNumber")); // Requires EmployeeNumber claim
        options.AddPolicy("AdminOnly", policy => policy.RequireRole("Administrator")); // Requires Administrator role
    });
}

// LoginController.cs
[HttpPost]
public async Task<IActionResult> Login(LoginViewModel model)
{
  // Checks omitted for brevity
  var user = await _userManager.FindByNameAsync(model.Username);
  var claim = new Claim("EmployeeNumber", "123");
  await _userManager.AddClaimAsync(user, claim);
}

[Authorize(Policy = "ClientsOnly")] // Allow premium clients only
public class AdminController : Controller { }

[Authorize(Role = "CorporateClient")] // Allow corporate clients only
public class AdminController : Controller { }

[Authorize(Policy = "EmployeeOnly")] // Apply EmployeeOnly policy
public class WorkController : Controller { }

[Authorize(Policy = "AdminOnly")] // Apply AdminOnly policy
public class AdminController : Controller { }

[Authorize(Policy = "ClientsOnly")] // Clients only that also have "Administrator" role (AND)
[Authorize(Roles = "Administrator")]
public class ClientAdminController : Controller { }
```
