# Authentication and authorization

## Explore Microsoft identity platform

The Microsoft identity platform for developers is a set of tools that includes authentication service, open-source libraries, and application management tools.

### Explore the Microsoft identity platform

The Microsoft identity platform helps you build applications your users and customers can sign in to using their Microsoft identities or social accounts, and provide authorized access to your own APIs or Microsoft APIs like Microsoft Graph.

There are several components that make up the Microsoft identity platform:

- **OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standard-compliant authentication service** enabling developers to authenticate several identity types, including:

  - Work or school accounts, provisioned through Microsoft Entra ID
  - Personal Microsoft account, like Skype, Xbox, and Outlook.com
  - Social or local accounts, by using Azure Active Directory B2C
  - Social or local customer accounts, by using Microsoft Entra External ID

- **Open-source libraries**: Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) and support for other standards-compliant libraries

- **Microsoft identity platform endpoint**: Works with the Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL) or any other standards-compliant library. It implements human readable scopes, in accordance with industry standards.

- **Application management portal**: A registration and configuration experience in the Azure portal, along with the other Azure management capabilities.

- **Application configuration API and PowerShell**: Programmatic configuration of your applications through the Microsoft Graph API and PowerShell so you can automate your DevOps tasks.

For developers, the Microsoft identity platform offers integration of modern innovations in the identity and security space like passwordless authentication, step-up authentication, and Conditional Access. You donâ€™t need to implement such functionality yourself: applications integrated with the Microsoft identity platform natively take advantage of such innovations.

### Explore service principals

To delegate Identity and Access Management functions to Microsoft Entra ID, an application must be registered with a Microsoft Entra tenant. When you register your application with Microsoft Entra ID, you're creating an identity configuration for your application that allows it to integrate with Microsoft Entra ID. When you register an app in the Azure portal, you choose whether it is:

- **Single tenant**: only accessible in your tenant
- **Multi-tenant**: accessible in other tenants

If you register an application in the portal, an application object (the globally unique instance of the app) and a service principal object are automatically created in your home tenant. You also have a globally unique ID for your app (the app or client ID). In the portal, you can then add secrets or certificates and scopes to make your app work, customize the branding of your app in the sign-in dialog, and more.

:information_source: You can also create service principal objects in a tenant using Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Microsoft Graph, and other tools.

#### Application object

A Microsoft Entra application is scoped to its one and only application object. The application object resides in the Microsoft Entra tenant where the application was registered (known as the application's "home" tenant). An application object is used as a template or blueprint to create one or more service principal objects. A service principal is created in every tenant where the application is used. Similar to a class in object-oriented programming, the application object has some static properties that are applied to all the created service principals (or application instances).

The application object describes three aspects of an application:

- How the service can issue tokens in order to access the application.
- Resources that the application might need to access.
- The actions that the application can take.

The Microsoft Graph [Application entity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/application) defines the schema for an application object's properties.

#### Service principal object

To access resources secured by a Microsoft Entra tenant, the entity that is requesting access must be represented by a security principal. This is true for both users (user principal) and applications (service principal).

The security principal defines the access policy and permissions for the user/application in the Microsoft Entra tenant. This enables core features such as authentication of the user/application during sign-in, and authorization during resource access.

There are three types of service principal:

- **Application** - This type of service principal is the local representation, or application instance, of a global application object in a single tenant or directory. A service principal is created in each tenant where the application is used, and references the globally unique app object. The service principal object defines what the app can actually do in the specific tenant, who can access the app, and what resources the app can access.
- **Managed identity** - This type of service principal is used to represent a [managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview). Managed identities provide an identity for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication. When a managed identity is enabled, a service principal representing that managed identity is created in your tenant. Service principals representing managed identities can be granted access and permissions, but can't be updated or modified directly.
- **Legacy** - This type of service principal represents a legacy app, which is an app created before app registrations were introduced or an app created through legacy experiences. A legacy service principal can have:
  - credentials
  - service principal names
  - reply URLs
  - and other properties that an authorized user can edit, but doesn't have an associated app registration.

#### Relationship between application objects and service principals

The application object is the _global_ representation of your application for use across all tenants, and the service principal is the _local_ representation for use in a specific tenant. The application object serves as the template from which common and default properties are _derived_ for use in creating corresponding service principal objects.

An application object has:

- A one to one relationship with the software application, and
- A one to many relationships with its corresponding service principal objects.

A service principal must be created in each tenant where the application is used to establish an identity for sign-in and/or access to resources being secured by the tenant. A single-tenant application has only one service principal (in its home tenant), created and consented for use during application registration. A multitenant application also has a service principal created in each tenant where a user from that tenant consented to its use.

### Discover permissions and consent

Applications that integrate with the Microsoft identity platform follow an authorization model that gives users and administrators control over how data can be accessed.

The Microsoft identity platform implements the OAuth 2.0 authorization protocol. [OAuth 2.0](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols) is a method through which a third-party app can access web-hosted resources on behalf of a user. Any web-hosted resource that integrates with the Microsoft identity platform has a resource identifier, or _application ID URI_.

Here are some examples of Microsoft web-hosted resources:

- Microsoft Graph: <https://graph.microsoft.com>
- Microsoft 365 Mail API: <https://outlook.office.com>
- Azure Key Vault: <https://vault.azure.net>

The same is true for any third-party resources that are integrated with the Microsoft identity platform. Any of these resources also can define a set of permissions that can be used to divide the functionality of that resource into smaller chunks. When a resource's functionality is chunked into small permission sets, third-party apps can be built to request only the permissions that they need to perform their function. Users and administrators can know what data the app can access.

In OAuth 2.0, these types of permission sets are called _scopes_. They're also often referred to as _permissions_. In the Microsoft identity platform, a permission is represented as a string value. An app requests the permissions it needs by specifying the permission in the `scope` query parameter. Identity platform supports several well-defined [OpenID Connect scopes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#openid-connect-scopes) and resource-based permissions (each permission is indicated by appending the permission value to the resource's identifier or application ID URI). For example, the permission string `https://graph.microsoft.com/Calendars.Read` is used to request permission to read users calendars in Microsoft Graph.

An app most commonly requests these permissions by specifying the scopes in requests to the Microsoft identity platform authorize endpoint. However, some high-privilege permissions can be granted only through administrator consent. They can be requested or granted by using the [administrator consent endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#admin-restricted-permissions).

:information_source: In requests to the authorization, token or consent endpoints for the Microsoft Identity platform, if the resource identifier is omitted in the scope parameter, the resource is assumed to be Microsoft Graph. For example, `scope=User.Read` is equivalent to `https://graph.microsoft.com/User.Read`.

#### Permission types

The Microsoft identity platform supports two types of permissions: _delegated access_ and _app-only access_.

- **Delegated access** are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps, either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests. The app is delegated with the permission to act as a signed-in user when it makes calls to the target resource.
- **App-only access permissions** are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present, for example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Only an administrator can consent to app-only access permissions.

#### Consent types

Applications in Microsoft identity platform rely on consent in order to gain access to necessary resources or APIs. There are many kinds of consent that your app might need to know about in order to be successful. If you're defining permissions, you'll also need to understand how your users gain access to your app or API.

There are three consent types: _static user consent_, _incremental and dynamic user consent_, and _admin consent_.

##### Static user consent

In the static user consent scenario, you must specify all the permissions it needs in the app's configuration in the Azure portal. If the user (or administrator, as appropriate) hasn't granted consent for this app, then Microsoft identity platform prompts the user to provide consent at this time. Static permissions also enable administrators to consent on behalf of all users in the organization.

While static permissions of the app defined in the Azure portal keep the code nice and simple, it presents some possible issues for developers:

- The app needs to request all the permissions it would ever need upon the user's first sign-in. This can lead to a long list of permissions that discourages end users from approving the app's access on initial sign-in.
- The app needs to know all of the resources it would ever access ahead of time. It's difficult to create apps that could access an arbitrary number of resources.

##### Incremental and dynamic user consent

With the Microsoft identity platform endpoint, you can ignore the static permissions defined in the app registration information in the Azure portal and request permissions incrementally instead. You can ask for a minimum set of permissions upfront and request more over time as the customer uses more app features.

To do so, you can specify the scopes your app needs at any time by including the new scopes in the `scope` parameter when requesting an access token - without the need to predefine them in the application registration information. If the user hasn't yet consented to new scopes added to the request, they're prompted to consent only to the new permissions. Incremental, or dynamic consent, only applies to delegated permissions and not to app-only access permissions.

:bangbang: Dynamic consent can be convenient, but presents a big challenge for permissions that require admin consent, since the admin consent experience doesn't know about those permissions at consent time. If you require admin privileged permissions or if your app uses dynamic consent, you must register all of the permissions in the Azure portal (not just the subset of permissions that require admin consent). This enables tenant admins to consent on behalf of all their users.

##### Admin consent

Admin consent is required when your app needs access to certain high-privilege permissions. Admin consent ensures that administrators have some other controls before authorizing apps or users to access highly privileged data from the organization.

Admin consent done on behalf of an organization still requires the static permissions registered for the app. Set those permissions for apps in the app registration portal if you need an admin to give consent on behalf of the entire organization. This reduces the cycles required by the organization admin to set up the application.

#### Requesting individual user consent

In an OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 authorization request, an app can request the permissions it needs by using the scope query parameter. For example, when a user signs in to an app, the app sends a request like the following example. Line breaks are added for legibility.

```http
GET https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=00001111-aaaa-2222-bbbb-3333cccc4444
&response_type=code
&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%2Fmyapp%2F
&response_mode=query
&scope=
https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fcalendars.read%20
https%3A%2F%2Fgraph.microsoft.com%2Fmail.send
&state=12345
```

The `scope` parameter is a space-separated list of delegated permissions that the app is requesting. Each permission is indicated by appending the permission value to the resource's identifier (the application ID URI). In the request example, the app needs permission to read the user's calendar and send mail as the user.

After the user enters their credentials, the Microsoft identity platform checks for a matching record of user consent. If the user hasn't consented to any of the requested permissions in the past, and if the administrator hasn't consented to these permissions on behalf of the entire organization, the Microsoft identity platform asks the user to grant the requested permissions.

### Discover conditional access

The Conditional Access feature in Microsoft Entra ID offers one of several ways that you can use to secure your app and protect a service. Conditional Access enables developers and enterprise customers to protect services in a multitude of ways including:

- [Multifactor authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-mfa-howitworks)
- Allowing only Intune enrolled devices to access specific services
- Restricting user locations and IP ranges

#### How does Conditional Access impact an app?

In most common cases, Conditional Access doesn't change an app's behavior or require any changes from the developer. Only in certain cases when an app indirectly or silently requests a token for a service does an app require code changes to handle Conditional Access challenges. It may be as simple as performing an interactive sign-in request.

Specifically, the following scenarios require code to handle Conditional Access challenges:

- Apps performing the on-behalf-of flow
- Apps accessing multiple services/resources
- Single-page apps using MSAL.js
- Web apps calling a resource

Conditional Access policies can be applied to the app and also a web API your app accesses. Depending on the scenario, an enterprise customer can apply and remove Conditional Access policies at any time. For your app to continue functioning when a new policy is applied, implement challenge handling.

#### Conditional Access examples

Some scenarios require code changes to handle Conditional Access whereas others work as is. Here are a few scenarios using Conditional Access to do multifactor authentication that gives some insight into the difference.

- You're building a single-tenant iOS app and apply a Conditional Access policy. The app signs in a user and doesn't request access to an API. When the user signs in, the policy is automatically invoked and the user needs to perform multifactor authentication.
- You're building an app that uses a middle tier service to access a downstream API. An enterprise customer at the company using this app applies a policy to the downstream API. When an end user signs in, the app requests access to the middle tier and sends the token. The middle tier performs on-behalf-of flow to request access to the downstream API. At this point, a claims "challenge" is presented to the middle tier. The middle tier sends the challenge back to the app, which needs to comply with the Conditional Access policy.

## Implement authentication by using the Microsoft Authentication Library

The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) enables developers to acquire tokens from the Microsoft identity platform in order to authenticate users and access secured web APIs.

### Explore the Microsoft Authentication Library

The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) enables developers to acquire security tokens from the Microsoft identity platform to authenticate users and access secured web APIs. It can be used to provide secure access to Microsoft Graph, other Microsoft APIs, third-party web APIs, or your own web API MSAL supports many different application architectures and platforms including .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, Android, and iOS.

MSAL gives you many ways to get tokens, with a consistent API for many platforms. Using MSAL provides the following benefits:

- No need to directly use the OAuth libraries or code against the protocol in your application.
- Acquires tokens on behalf of a user or on behalf of an application (when applicable to the platform).
- Maintains a token cache and refreshes tokens for you when they're close to expire. You don't need to handle token expiration on your own.
- Helps you specify which audience you want your application to sign in.
- Helps you set up your application from configuration files.
- Helps you troubleshoot your app by exposing actionable exceptions, logging, and telemetry.

#### Application types and scenarios

Using MSAL, a token can be acquired from many application types: web applications, web APIs, single-page apps (JavaScript), mobile and native applications, and daemons and server-side applications. MSAL currently supports the platforms and frameworks listed in the following table.

| Client credentials                      | Access to web APIs by using the identity of the application itself. Typically used for server-to-server communication and automated scripts requiring no user interaction.                       | Daemon                                    |
| Device code                             | User sign-in and access to web APIs on behalf of the user on input-constrained devices like smart TVs and IoT devices. Also used by command line interface (CLI) applications.                   | Desktop, Mobile                           |
| Implicit grant                          | User sign-in and access to web APIs on behalf of the user. The implicit grant flow is no longer recommended - use authorization code with PKCE instead.                                          | SPA, Web                                  |

##### Public client and confidential client applications

The Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) defines two types of clients; public clients and confidential clients. A client is a software entity that has a unique identifier assigned by an identity provider. The client types differ based their ability to authenticate securely with the authorization server and to hold sensitive, identity proving information so that it can't be accessed or known to a user within the scope of its access.

When examining the public or confidential nature of a given client, we're evaluating the ability of that client to prove its identity to the authorization server. This is important because the authorization server must be able to trust the identity of the client in order to issue access tokens.

- **Public client applications** run on devices, such as desktop, browserless APIs, mobile or client-side browser apps. They can't be trusted to safely keep application secrets, so they can only access web APIs on behalf of the user. Anytime the source, or compiled bytecode of a given app, is transmitted anywhere it can be read, disassembled, or otherwise inspected by untrusted parties. As they also only support public client flows and can't hold configuration-time secrets, they can't have client secrets.
- **Confidential client applications** run on servers, such as web apps, web API apps, or service/daemon apps. They're considered difficult to access by users or attackers, and therefore can adequately hold configuration-time secrets to assert proof of its identity. The client ID is exposed through the web browser, but the secret is passed only in the back channel and never directly exposed.

### Initialize client applications

With MSAL.NET 3.x, the recommended way to instantiate an application is by using the application builders: `PublicClientApplicationBuilder` and `ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder`. They offer a powerful mechanism to configure the application either from the code, or from a configuration file, or even by mixing both approaches.

Before initializing an application, you first need to register it so that your app can be integrated with the Microsoft identity platform. After registration, you may need the following information (which can be found in the Azure portal):

- **Application (client) ID** - This is a string representing a GUID.
- **Directory (tenant) ID** - Provides identity and access management (IAM) capabilities to applications and resources used by your organization. It can specify if you're writing a line of business application solely for your organization (also named single-tenant application).
- The identity provider URL (named the **instance**) and the sign-in audience for your application. These two parameters are collectively known as the authority.
- **Client credentials** - which can take the form of an application secret (client secret string) or certificate (of type `X509Certificate2`) if it's a confidential client app.
- For web apps, and sometimes for public client apps (in particular when your app needs to use a broker), you need to set the **Redirect URI** where the identity provider will contact back your application with the security tokens.

#### Initializing public and confidential client applications from code

The following code instantiates a public client application, signing-in users in the Microsoft Azure public cloud, with their work and school accounts, or their personal Microsoft accounts.

```csharp
IPublicClientApplication app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId).Build();
```

In the same way, the following code instantiates a confidential application (a Web app located at `https://myapp.azurewebsites.net`) handling tokens from users in the Microsoft Azure public cloud, with their work and school accounts, or their personal Microsoft accounts. The application is identified with the identity provider by sharing a client secret:

```csharp
string redirectUri = "https://myapp.azurewebsites.net";
IConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
    .WithRedirectUri(redirectUri )
    .Build();
```

#### Builder modifiers

In the code snippets using application builders, `.With` methods can be applied as modifiers (for example, `.WithAuthority` and `.WithRedirectUri`).

- `.WithAuthority` modifier: The `.WithAuthority` modifier sets the application default authority to a Microsoft Entra authority, with the possibility of choosing the Azure Cloud, the audience, the tenant (tenant ID or domain name), or providing directly the authority URI.

  ```csharp
  IPublicClientApplication app;
  app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
      .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, tenantId)
      .Build();
  ```

- `.WithRedirectUri` modifier: The `.WithRedirectUri` modifier overrides the default redirect URI.

  ```csharp
  IPublicClientApplication app;
  app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(client_id)
      .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, tenant_id)
      .WithRedirectUri("http://localhost")
      .Build();
  ```

#### Modifiers common to public and confidential client applications

The table below lists some of the modifiers you can set on a public, or confidential client.

| Modifier                                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Modifiers specific to confidential client applications

The modifiers specific to a confidential client application builder can be found in the `ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder` class. The different methods can be found in the [Azure SDK for .NET documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.identity.client.confidentialclientapplicationbuilder).

Modifiers such as `.WithCertificate(X509Certificate2 certificate)` and `.WithClientSecret(string clientSecret)` are mutually exclusive. If you provide both, MSAL throws a meaningful exception.
