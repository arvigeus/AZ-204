# Azure App Service

## Explore Azure App Service

Learn about the key components of Azure App Service and how App Service can help you create, maintain, and deploy web apps more efficiently.

### Examine Azure App Service

Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite programming language or framework. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

#### Built-in auto scale support

The ability to scale up/down or scale out/in is baked into the Azure App Service. Depending on the usage of the web app, you can scale the resources of the underlying machine that is hosting your web app up/down. Resources include the number of cores or the amount of RAM available. Scaling out/in is the ability to increase, or decrease, the number of machine instances that are running your web app.

#### Container support

With Azure App Service, you can deploy and run containerized web apps on Windows and Linux. You can pull container images from a private Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub. Azure App Service also supports multi-container apps, Windows containers, and Docker Compose for orchestrating container instances.

#### Continuous integration/deployment support

The Azure portal provides out-of-the-box continuous integration and deployment with Azure DevOps Services, GitHub, Bitbucket, FTP, or a local Git repository on your development machine. Connect your web app with any of the above sources and App Service will do the rest for you by autosyncing code and any future changes on the code into the web app. Continuous integration and deployment for containerized web apps is also supported using either Azure Container Registry or Docker Hub.

#### Deployment slots

When deploying a web app, you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot when you're running in the Standard App Service Plan tier or better. Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names. App content and configurations elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.

#### App Service on Linux

App Service can also host web apps natively on Linux for supported application stacks. It can also run custom Linux containers (also known as _Web App for Containers_). App Service on Linux supports many language specific built-in images. Just deploy your code. Supported languages and frameworks include: .NET Core, Java (Tomcat, JBoss EAP, or Java SE with an embedded web server), Node.js, Python, and PHP. If the runtime your application requires isn't supported in the built-in images, you can deploy it with a custom container.

The languages, and their supported versions, are updated regularly. You can retrieve the current list by using the following command in the Cloud Shell.

```sh
az webapp list-runtimes --os-type linux
```

##### Limitations

App Service on Linux does have some limitations:

- App Service on Linux isn't supported on Shared pricing tier.
- The Azure portal shows only features that currently work for Linux apps. As features are enabled, they're activated on the portal.
- When deployed to built-in images, your code and content are allocated a storage volume for web content, backed by Azure Storage. The disk latency of this volume is higher and more variable than the latency of the container filesystem. Apps that require heavy read-only access to content files might benefit from the custom container option, which places files in the container filesystem instead of on the content volume.

#### App Service Environment

App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for running App Service apps. It offers improved security at high scale.

Unlike the App Service offering, where supporting infrastructure is shared, with App Service Environment, compute is dedicated to a single customer. For more information on the differences between App Service Environment and App Service, see the [comparison](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/environment/ase-multi-tenant-comparison).

### Examine Azure App Service plans

In App Service, an app always runs in an _App Service plan_. An App Service plan defines a set of compute resources for a web app to run. One or more apps can be configured to run on the same computing resources (or in the same App Service plan).

When you create an App Service plan in a certain region (for example, West Europe), a set of compute resources is created for that plan in that region. Whatever apps you put into this App Service plan run on these compute resources as defined by your App Service plan. Each App Service plan defines:

- Operating System (Windows, Linux)
- Region (West US, East US, etc.)
- Number of VM instances
- Size of VM instances (Small, Medium, Large)
- Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, Isolated, IsolatedV2)

The _pricing tier_ of an App Service plan determines what App Service features you get and how much you pay for the plan. There are a few categories of pricing tiers:

- **Shared compute**: **Free** and **Shared**, the two base tiers, runs an app on the same Azure VM as other App Service apps, including apps of other customers. These tiers allocate CPU quotas to each app that runs on the shared resources, and the resources can't scale out.
- **Dedicated compute**: The **Basic**, **Standard**, **Premium**, **PremiumV2**, and **PremiumV3** tiers run apps on dedicated Azure VMs. Only apps in the same App Service plans share the same compute resources. The higher the tier, the more VM instances are available to you for scale-out.
- **Isolated**: The **Isolated** and **IsolatedV2** tiers run dedicated Azure VMs on dedicated Azure Virtual Networks. It provides network isolation on top of compute isolation to your apps. It provides the maximum scale-out capabilities.

:information_source: App Service Free and Shared (preview) hosting plans are base tiers that run on the same Azure virtual machines as other App Service apps. Some apps might belong to other customers. These tiers are intended to be used only for development and testing purposes.

#### How does my app run and scale

In the **Free** and **Shared** tiers, an app receives CPU minutes on a shared VM instance and can't scale out. In other tiers, an app runs and scales as follows:

- An app runs on all the VM instances configured in the App Service plan.
- If multiple apps are in the same App Service plan, they all share the same VM instances.
- If you have multiple deployment slots for an app, all deployment slots also run on the same VM instances.
- If you enable diagnostic logs, perform backups, or run WebJobs, they also use CPU cycles and memory on these VM instances.

In this way, the App Service plan is the **scale unit** of the App Service apps. If the plan is configured to run five VM instances, then all apps in the plan run on all five instances. If the plan is configured for autoscaling, then all apps in the plan are scaled out together based on the autoscale settings.

#### What if my app needs more capabilities or features

Your App Service plan can be scaled up and down at any time. It's as simple as changing the pricing tier of the plan. If your app is in the same App Service plan with other apps, you might want to improve the app's performance by isolating the compute resources. You can do it by moving the app into a separate App Service plan.

You can potentially save money by putting multiple apps into one App Service plan. However, since apps in the same App Service plan all share the same compute resources you need to understand the capacity of the existing App Service plan and the expected load for the new app.

Isolate your app into a new App Service plan when:

- The app is resource-intensive.
- You want to scale the app independently from the other apps in the existing plan.
- The app needs resource in a different geographical region.

This way you can allocate a new set of resources for your app and gain greater control of your apps.

### Deploy to App Service

Every development team has unique requirements that can make implementing an efficient deployment pipeline difficult on any cloud service. App Service supports both automated and manual deployment.

#### Automated deployment

Automated deployment, or continuous deployment, is a process used to push out new features and bug fixes in a fast and repetitive pattern with minimal effect on end users.

Azure supports automated deployment directly from several sources. The following options are available:

- **Azure DevOps Services**: You can push your code to Azure DevOps Services, build your code in the cloud, run the tests, generate a release from the code, and finally, push your code to an Azure Web App.
- **GitHub**: Azure supports automated deployment directly from GitHub. When you connect your GitHub repository to Azure for automated deployment, any changes you push to your production branch on GitHub are automatically deployed for you.
- **Bitbucket**: With its similarities to GitHub, you can configure an automated deployment with Bitbucket.

#### Manual deployment

There are a few options that you can use to manually push your code to Azure:

- **Git**: App Service web apps feature a Git URL that you can add as a remote repository. Pushing to the remote repository deploys your app.
- **CLI**: `webapp up` is a feature of the `az` command-line interface that packages your app and deploys it. Unlike other deployment methods, `az webapp up` can create a new App Service web app for you.
- **Zip deploy**: Use `curl` or a similar HTTP utility to send a ZIP of your application files to App Service.
- **FTP/S**: FTP or FTPS is a traditional way of pushing your code to many hosting environments, including App Service.

#### Use deployment slots

Whenever possible, use deployment slots when deploying a new production build. When using a Standard App Service Plan tier or better, you can deploy your app to a staging environment and then swap your staging and production slots. The swap operation warms up the necessary worker instances to match your production scale, thus eliminating downtime.

##### Continuously deploy code

If your project designates branches for testing, QA, and staging, then each of those branches should be continuously deployed to a staging slot. This allows your stakeholders to easily assess and test the deployed branch.

##### Continuously deploy containers

For custom containers from Azure Container Registry or other container registries, deploy the image into a staging slot and swap into production to prevent downtime. The automation is more complex than code deployment because you must push the image to a container registry and update the image tag on the webapp.

- **Build and tag the image**: As part of the build pipeline, tag the image with the git commit ID, timestamp, or other identifiable information. It’s best not to use the default "latest" tag. Otherwise, it’s difficult to trace back what code is currently deployed, which makes debugging far more difficult.
- **Push the tagged image**: Once the image is built and tagged, the pipeline pushes the image to our container registry. In the next step, the deployment slot will pull the tagged image from the container registry.
- **Update the deployment slot with the new image tag**: When this property is updated, the site automatically restarts and pulls the new container image.

#### Sidecar containers

In Azure App Service, you can add up to nine sidecar containers for each sidecar-enabled custom container app. Sidecar containers let you deploy extra services and features to your container application without making them tightly coupled to your main application container. For example, you can add monitoring, logging, configuration, and networking services as sidecar containers.

You can add a sidecar container through the **Deployment Center** in the app's management page.

### Explore authentication and authorization in App Service

Azure App Service provides built-in authentication and authorization support. You can sign in users and access data by writing minimal or no code in your web app, RESTful API, mobile back end, or Azure Functions.

#### Why use the built-in authentication

You're not required to use App Service for authentication and authorization. Many web frameworks are bundled with security features, and you can use them if you like. If you need more flexibility than App Service provides, you can also write your own utilities.

The built-in authentication feature for App Service and Azure Functions can save you time and effort by providing out-of-the-box authentication with federated identity providers, allowing you to focus on the rest of your application.

- Azure App Service allows you to integrate various auth capabilities into your web app or API without implementing them yourself.
- Auth is built directly into the platform and doesn’t require any particular language, SDK, security expertise, or code.
- You can integrate with multiple login providers. For example, Microsoft Entra ID, Facebook, Google, X.

#### Identity providers

App Service uses federated identity, in which a third-party identity provider manages the user identities and authentication flow for you. The following identity providers are available by default:

| Provider                    | Sign-in endpoint              | How-To guidance                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft Entra             | `/.auth/login/aad`            | [App Service Microsoft Entra login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad)           |
| Facebook                    | `/.auth/login/facebook`       | [App Service Facebook login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-facebook)             |
| Google                      | `/.auth/login/google`         | [App Service Google login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-google)                 |
| X                           | `/.auth/login/x`              | [App Service X login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-twitter)                     |
| Any OpenID Connect provider | `/.auth/login/<providerName>` | [App Service OpenID Connect login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-openid-connect) |
| GitHub                      | `/.auth/login/github`         | [App Service GitHub login](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-github)                 |

When you configure this feature with one of these providers, its sign-in endpoint is available for user authentication and for validation of authentication tokens from the provider. You can provide your users with any number of these sign-in options.

#### How it works

The authentication and authorization middleware component is a feature of the platform that runs on the same VM as your application. When enabled, every incoming HTTP request passes through it before being handled by your application.

The platform middleware handles several things for your app:

- Authenticates users and clients with the specified identity provider
- Validates, stores, and refreshes OAuth tokens issued by the configured identity provider
- Manages the authenticated session
- Injects identity information into HTTP request headers

The module runs separately from your application code and can be configured using Azure Resource Manager settings or using a configuration file. No SDKs, specific programming languages, or changes to your application code are required.

:information_source: In Linux and containers the authentication and authorization module runs in a separate container, isolated from your application code. Because it doesn't run in-process, no direct integration with specific language frameworks is possible.

##### Authentication flow

The authentication flow is the same for all providers, but differs depending on whether you want to sign in with the provider's SDK.

- Without provider SDK: The application delegates federated sign-in to App Service. This delegation is typically the case with browser apps, which can present the provider's login page to the user. The server code manages the sign-in process and is referred to as _server-directed flow_ or _server flow_.
- With provider SDK: The application signs users in to the provider manually and then submits the authentication token to App Service for validation. This is typically the case with browser-less apps, which can't present the provider's sign-in page to the user. The application code manages the sign-in process and is referred to as _client-directed flow_ or _client flow_. This applies to REST APIs, Azure Functions, JavaScript browser clients, and native mobile apps that sign users in using the provider's SDK.

The following table shows the steps of the authentication flow.

| Step                            | Without provider SDK                                                                            | With provider SDK                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sign user in                    | Redirects client to `/.auth/login/<provider>`                                                   | Client code signs user in directly with provider's SDK and receives an authentication token. For information, see the provider's documentation. |
| Post-authentication             | Provider redirects client to `/.auth/login/<provider>/callback`                                 | Client code posts token from provider to `/.auth/login/<provider>` for validation.                                                              |
| Establish authenticated session | App Service adds authenticated cookie to response                                               | App Service returns its own authentication token to client code                                                                                 |
| Serve authenticated content     | Client includes authentication cookie in subsequent requests (automatically handled by browser) | Client code presents authentication token in `X-ZUMO-AUTH` header (automatically handled by Mobile Apps client SDKs)                            |

For client browsers, App Service can automatically direct all unauthenticated users to `/.auth/login/<provider>`. You can also present users with one or more `/.auth/login/<provider>` links to sign in to your app using their provider of choice.

##### Authorization behavior

In the Azure portal, you can configure App Service with many behaviors when an incoming request isn't authenticated.

- **Allow unauthenticated requests**: This option defers authorization of unauthenticated traffic to your application code. For authenticated requests, App Service also passes along authentication information in the HTTP headers. This option provides more flexibility in handling anonymous requests. It lets you present multiple sign-in providers to your users.

- **Require authentication**: This option rejects any unauthenticated traffic to your application. This rejection can be a redirect action to one of the configured identity providers. In these cases, a browser client is redirected to `/.auth/login/<provider>` for the provider you choose. If the anonymous request comes from a native mobile app, the returned response is an HTTP 401 Unauthorized. You can also configure the rejection to be an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` or `HTTP 403 Forbidden` for all requests.

  :stop_sign: Restricting access in this way applies to all calls to your app, which may not be desirable for apps wanting a publicly available home page, as in many single-page applications.

##### Token store

App Service provides a built-in token store, which is a repository of tokens that are associated with the users of your web apps, APIs, or native mobile apps. When you enable authentication with any provider, this token store is immediately available to your app.

##### Logging and tracing

If you enable application logging, authentication and authorization traces are collected directly in your log files. If you see an authentication error that you didn't expect, you can conveniently find all the details by looking in your existing application logs.

### Discover App Service networking features

By default, apps hosted in App Service are accessible directly through the internet and can reach only internet-hosted endpoints. For many applications, you need to control the inbound and outbound network traffic.

There are two main deployment types for Azure App Service:

- The multitenant public service hosts App Service plans in the Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, and PremiumV3 pricing SKUs.
- The single-tenant App Service Environment (ASE) hosts Isolated SKU App Service plans directly in your Azure virtual network.

#### Multitenant App Service networking features

Azure App Service is a distributed system. The roles that handle incoming HTTP or HTTPS requests are called _front ends_. The roles that host the customer workload are called _workers_. All the roles in an App Service deployment exist in a multitenant network. Because there are many different customers in the same App Service scale unit, you can't connect the App Service network directly to your network.

Instead of connecting the networks, you need features to handle the various aspects of application communication. The features that handle requests to your app can't be used to solve problems when you're making calls from your app. Likewise, the features that solve problems for calls from your app can't be used to solve problems to your app.

| Inbound features     | Outbound features                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| App-assigned address | Hybrid Connections                           |
| Access restrictions  | Gateway-required virtual network integration |
| Service endpoints    | Virtual network integration                  |
| Private endpoints    |                                              |

You can mix the features to solve your problems with a few exceptions. The following inbound use cases are examples of how to use App Service networking features to control traffic inbound to your app.

| Inbound use case                                                 | Feature              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Support IP-based SSL needs for your app                          | App-assigned address |
| Support unshared dedicated inbound address for your app          | App-assigned address |
| Restrict access to your app from a set of well-defined addresses | Access restrictions  |

#### Default networking behavior

Azure App Service scale units support many customers in each deployment. The Free and Shared SKU plans host customer workloads on multitenant workers. The Basic and higher plans host customer workloads that are dedicated to only one App Service plan. If you have a Standard App Service plan, all the apps in that plan run on the same worker. If you scale out the worker, all the apps in that App Service plan are replicated on a new worker for each instance in your App Service plan.

##### Outbound addresses

The worker virtual machines are broken down in large part by the App Service plans. The Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, and Premium plans all use the same worker virtual machine type. The PremiumV2 plan uses another virtual machine type. PremiumV3 uses yet another virtual machine type. When you change the virtual machine family, you get a different set of outbound addresses.

There are many addresses that are used for outbound calls. The outbound addresses used by your app for making outbound calls are listed in the properties for your app. These addresses are shared by all the apps running on the same worker virtual machine family in the App Service deployment. If you want to see all the addresses that your app might use in a scale unit, there's a property called `possibleOutboundIpAddresses` that lists them.

##### Find outbound IPs

To find the outbound IP addresses currently used by your app in the Azure portal, select **Properties** in your app's left-hand navigation.

You can find the same information by running the following Azure CLI command in the Cloud Shell. They're listed in the **Additional Outbound IP Addresses** field.

```sh
az webapp show \
    --resource-group <group_name> \
    --name <app_name> \
    --query outboundIpAddresses \
    --output tsv
```

To find all possible outbound IP addresses for your app, regardless of pricing tiers, run the following command in the Cloud Shell.

```sh
az webapp show \
    --resource-group <group_name> \
    --name <app_name> \
    --query possibleOutboundIpAddresses \
    --output tsv
```

## Configure web app settings

In App Service, app settings are variables passed as environment variables to the application code.

### Configure application settings

In App Service, app settings are variables passed as environment variables to the application code. For Linux apps and custom containers, App Service passes app settings to the container using the `--env` flag to set the environment variable in the container. In either case, they're injected into your app environment at app startup. When you add, remove, or edit app settings, App Service triggers an app restart.

For ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core developers, setting app settings in App Service is like setting them in `<appSettings>` in _Web.config_ or _appsettings.json_, but the values in App Service override the ones in _Web.config_ or _appsettings.json_. You can keep development settings (for example, local MySQL password) in _Web.config_ or _appsettings.json_ and production secrets (for example, Azure MySQL database password) safely in App Service. The same code uses your development settings when you debug locally, and it uses your production secrets when deployed to Azure.

App settings are always encrypted when stored (encrypted-at-rest). App settings names can only contain letters, numbers (0-9), periods ("."), and underscores ("\_") Special characters in the value of an App Setting must be escaped as needed by the target OS.

Application settings can be accessed by navigating to your app's management page and selecting **Environment variables > Application settings**.

![Screenshot of Navigating to Environment variables > Application settings.](../../wwl-azure/configure-web-app-settings/media/configure-app-settings.png)

#### Adding and editing settings

To add a new app setting, select **\+ Add**. If you're using deployment slots, you can specify if your setting is swappable or not. In the dialog, you can stick the setting to the current slot.

![Selecting deployment slot setting to stick the setting to the current slot.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-web-app-settings/media/app-configure-slotsetting.png)

When finished, select **Apply**. Don't forget to select **Apply** back in the **Environment variables** page.

:information_source: In a default Linux app service or a custom Linux container, any nested JSON key structure in the app setting name like `ApplicationInsights:InstrumentationKey` needs to be configured in App Service as `ApplicationInsights__InstrumentationKey` for the key name. In other words, replace any `:` with `__` (double underscore). Any periods in the app setting name are replaced with a `*` (single underscore).

##### Editing application settings in bulk

To add or edit app settings in bulk, select the **Advanced edit** button. When finished, select **OK**. Don't forget to select Apply back in the Environment variables page. App settings have the following JSON formatting:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "name": "<key-1>",
    "value": "<value-1>",
    "slotSetting": false
  },
  {
    "name": "<key-2>",
    "value": "<value-2>",
    "slotSetting": false
  }
  // ...
]
```

#### Configure connection strings

For ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core developers, setting connection strings in App Service are like setting them in `<connectionStrings>` in _Web.config_, but the values you set in App Service override the ones in _Web.config_. For other language stacks, it's better to use app settings instead, because connection strings require special formatting in the variable keys in order to access the values.

:point_up: There's one case where you may want to use connection strings instead of app settings for non-.NET languages: certain Azure database types are backed up along with the app \_only\* if you configure a connection string for the database in your App Service app.

Adding and editing connection strings follow the same principles as other app settings and they can also be tied to deployment slots. An example of connection strings in JSON formatting that you would use for bulk adding or editing:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "name": "name-1",
    "value": "conn-string-1",
    "type": "SQLServer",
    "slotSetting": false
  },
  {
    "name": "name-2",
    "value": "conn-string-2",
    "type": "PostgreSQL",
    "slotSetting": false
  }
  // ...
]
```

:information_source: .NET apps targeting PostgreSQL should set the connection string to **Custom** as work around for a known issue in .NET `EnvironmentVariablesConfigurationProvider`.

At runtime, connection strings are available as environment variables, prefixed with the following connection types:

- SQLServer: `SQLCONNSTR_`
- MySQL: `MYSQLCONNSTR_`
- SQLAzure: `SQLAZURECONNSTR_`
- Custom: `CUSTOMCONNSTR_`
- PostgreSQL: `POSTGRESQLCONNSTR_`
- Notification Hub: `NOTIFICATIONHUBCONNSTR_`
- Service Bus: `SERVICEBUSCONNSTR_`
- Event Hub: `EVENTHUBCONNSTR_`
- Document DB: `DOCDBCONNSTR_`
- Redis Cache: `REDISCACHECONNSTR_`

For example, a MySQL connection string named _connectionstring1_ can be accessed as the environment variable `MYSQLCONNSTR_connectionString1`.

### Configure environment variables for custom containers

Your custom container might use environment variables that need to be supplied externally. You can pass them in via the Cloud Shell. In Bash:

```bash
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings key1=value1 key2=value2
```

In PowerShell:

```ps
Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"DB_HOST"="myownserver.mysql.database.azure.com"}
```

When your app runs, the App Service app settings are injected into the process as environment variables automatically. You can verify container environment variables with the URL `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env`.

### Configure general settings

In the **Configuration > General settings** section you can configure some common settings for your app. Some settings require you to scale up to higher pricing tiers.

![Screenshot of navigating to Configure > General settings.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-web-app-settings/media/configure-general-settings.png)

A list of the currently available settings:

- **Stack settings**: The software stack to run the app, including the language and SDK versions. For Linux apps and custom container apps, you can also set an optional start-up command or file.

  ![Establishing the stack settings that include the programming language.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/configure-web-app-settings/media/open-general-linux.png)

- **Platform settings**: Lets you configure settings for the hosting platform, including:

  - **Platform bitness**: 32-bit or 64-bit. For Windows apps only.
  - **FTP state**: Allow only FTPS or disable FTP altogether.
  - **HTTP version**: Set to **2.0** to enable support for HTTPS/2 protocol.

    :information_source: Most modern browsers support HTTP/2 protocol over TLS only, while nonencrypted traffic continues to use HTTP/1.1. To ensure that client browsers connect to your app with HTTP/2, secure your custom DNS name.

  - **Web sockets**: For ASP.NET SignalR or socket.io, for example.
  - **Always On**: Keeps the app loaded even when there's no traffic. When **Always On** isn't turned on (default), the app is unloaded after 20 minutes without any incoming requests. The unloaded app can cause high latency for new requests because of its warm-up time. When **Always On** is turned on, the front-end load balancer sends a GET request to the application root every five minutes. The continuous ping prevents the app from being unloaded.

    Always On is required for continuous WebJobs or for WebJobs that are triggered using a CRON expression.

  - **Managed pipeline version**: The IIS pipeline mode. Set it to **Classic** if you have a legacy app that requires an older version of IIS.
  - **HTTP version**: Set to 2.0 to enable support for HTTPS/2 protocol.
  - **ARR affinity**: In a multi-instance deployment, ensure that the client is routed to the same instance for the life of the session. You can set this option to **Off** for stateless applications.
  - **HTTPS Only**: When enabled, all HTTP traffic is redirected to HTTPS.
  - **Minimum TLS version**: Select the minimum TLS encryption version required by your app.

- **Debugging**: Enable remote debugging for ASP.NET, ASP.NET Core, or Node.js apps. This option turns off automatically after 48 hours.
- **Incoming client certificates**: Require client certificates in mutual authentication. TLS mutual authentication is used to restrict access to your app by enabling different types of authentication for it.

### Configure path mappings

In the **Configuration** > **Path mappings** section you can configure handler mappings, and virtual application and directory mappings. The **Path mappings** page displays different options based on the OS type.

#### Windows apps (uncontainerized)

For Windows apps, you can customize the IIS handler mappings and virtual applications and directories.

Handler mappings let you add custom script processors to handle requests for specific file extensions. To add a custom handler, select **New handler mapping**. Configure the handler as follows:

- **Extension**: The file extension you want to handle, such as _\*.php_ or _handler.fcgi_.
- **Script processor**: The absolute path of the script processor. Requests to files that match the file extension are processed by the script processor. Use the path `D:\home\site\wwwroot` to refer to your app's root directory.
- **Arguments**: Optional command-line arguments for the script processor.

Each app has the default root path (`/`) mapped to `D:\home\site\wwwroot`, where your code is deployed by default. If your app root is in a different folder, or if your repository has more than one application, you can edit or add virtual applications and directories.

You can configure virtual applications and directories by specifying each virtual directory and its corresponding physical path relative to the website root (`D:\home`). To mark a virtual directory as a web application, clear the **Directory** check box.

#### Linux and containerized apps

You can add custom storage for your containerized app. Containerized apps include all Linux apps and also the Windows and Linux custom containers running on App Service. Select **New Azure Storage Mount** and configure your custom storage as follows:

- **Name**: The display name.
- **Configuration options**: **Basic** or **Advanced**. Select **Basic** if the storage account isn't using service endpoints, private endpoints, or Azure Key Vault. Otherwise, select **Advanced**.
- Storage accounts: The storage account with the container you want.
- **Storage type**: **Azure Blobs** or **Azure Files**. Windows container apps only support Azure Files. Azure Blobs only supports read-only access.
- **Storage container**: For basic configuration, the container you want.
- **Share name**: For advanced configuration, the file share name.
- **Access key**: For advanced configuration, the access key.
- **Mount path**: The absolute path in your container to mount the custom storage.
- **Deployment slot setting**: When checked, the storage mount settings also apply to deployment slots.

### Enable diagnostic logging

There are built-in diagnostics to assist with debugging an App Service app. In this lesson, you learn how to enable diagnostic logging and add instrumentation to your application, and how to access the information logged by Azure.

The following table shows the types of logging, the platforms supported, and where the logs can be stored and located for accessing the information.

| Type                    | Platform       | Location                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application logging     | Windows, Linux | App Service file system and/or Azure Storage blobs | Logs messages generated by your application code. The messages are generated by the web framework you choose, or from your application code directly using the standard logging pattern of your language. Each message is assigned one of the following categories: Critical, Error, Warning, Info, Debug, and Trace. |
| Web server logging      | Windows        | App Service file system or Azure Storage blobs     | Raw HTTP request data in the W3C extended log file format. Each log message includes data like the HTTP method, resource URI, client IP, client port, user agent, response code, and so on.                                                                                                                           |
| Detailed error messages | Windows        | App Service file system                            | Copies of the _.html_ error pages that would otherwise be sent to the client browser. For security reasons, detailed error pages shouldn't be sent to clients in production, but App Service can save the error page each time an application error occurs that has HTTP code 400 or greater.                         |
| Failed request tracing  | Windows        | App Service file system                            | Detailed tracing information on failed requests, including a trace of the IIS components used to process the request and the time taken in each component. One folder is generated for each failed request, which contains the XML log file and the XSL stylesheet to view the log file with.                         |
| Deployment logging      | Windows, Linux | App Service file system                            | Helps determine why a deployment failed. Deployment logging happens automatically and there are no configurable settings for deployment logging.                                                                                                                                                                      |

#### Enable application logging (Windows)

1. To enable application logging for Windows apps in the Azure portal, navigate to your app and select **App Service logs**.

1. Select **On** for either **Application Logging (Filesystem)** or **Application Logging (Blob)**, or both. The **Filesystem** option is for temporary debugging purposes, and turns itself off in 12 hours. The **Blob** option is for long-term logging, and needs a blob storage container to write logs to.

:information_source: If you regenerate your storage account's access keys, you must reset the respective logging configuration to use the updated access keys. To do this turn the logging feature off and then on again.

1. You can also set the **Level** of details included in the log as shown in the following table.

| Level       | Included categories                          |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Disabled    | None                                         |
| Error       | Error, Critical                              |
| Warning     | Warning, Error, Critical                     |
| Information | Info, Warning, Error, Critical               |
| Verbose     | Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical |

1. When finished, select **Save**.

#### Enable application logging (Linux/Container)

1. In **App Service logs** set the **Application logging** option to **File System**.
1. In **Quota (MB)**, specify the disk quota for the application logs. In **Retention Period (Days)**, set the number of days the logs should be retained.
1. When finished, select **Save**.

#### Enable web server logging

1. For **Web server logging**, select **Storage** to store logs on blob storage, or **File System** to store logs on the App Service file system.
1. In **Retention Period (Days)**, set the number of days the logs should be retained.
1. When finished, select **Save**.

#### Add log messages in code

In your application code, you use the usual logging facilities to send log messages to the application logs. For example:

- ASP.NET applications can use the System.Diagnostics.Trace class to log information to the application diagnostics log. For example:

  ```csharp
  System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError("If you're seeing this, something bad happened");
  ```

  By default, ASP.NET Core uses the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices` logging provider.

#### Stream logs

Before you stream logs in real time, enable the log type that you want. Any information written to files ending in .txt, .log, or .htm that are stored in the `/LogFiles` directory (`d:/home/logfiles`) is streamed by App Service.

:information_source: Some types of logging buffer write to the log file, which can result in out of order events in the stream. For example, an application log entry that occurs when a user visits a page may be displayed in the stream before the corresponding HTTP log entry for the page request.

- Azure portal - To stream logs in the Azure portal, navigate to your app and select **Log stream**.
- Azure CLI - To stream logs live in Cloud Shell, use the following command:

  ```sh
  az webapp log tail --name appname --resource-group myResourceGroup
  ```

- Local console - To stream logs in the local console, install Azure CLI and sign in to your account. Once signed in, follow the instructions shown for Azure CLI.

#### Access log files

If you configure the Azure Storage blobs option for a log type, you need a client tool that works with Azure Storage.

For logs stored in the App Service file system, the easiest way is to download the ZIP file in the browser at:

- Linux/container apps: `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker/zip`
- Windows apps: `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/dump`

For Linux/container apps, the ZIP file contains console output logs for both the docker host and the docker container. For a scaled-out app, the ZIP file contains one set of logs for each instance. In the App Service file system, these log files are the contents of the _/home/LogFiles_ directory.

### Configure security certificates

Azure App Service has tools that let you create, upload, or import a private certificate or a public certificate into App Service.

A certificate uploaded into an app is stored in a deployment unit that is bound to the app service plan's resource group and region combination (internally called a _webspace_). The certificate is accessible to other apps in the same resource group and region combination.

The table below details the options you have for adding certificates in App Service:

| Option                                        | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create a free App Service managed certificate | A private certificate that's free of charge and easy to use if you just need to secure your custom domain in App Service.                                 |
| Purchase an App Service certificate           | A private certificate managed by Azure. It combines the simplicity of automated certificate management and the flexibility of renewal and export options. |
| Import a certificate from Key Vault           | Useful if you use Azure Key Vault to manage your certificates.                                                                                            |
| Upload a private certificate                  | If you already have a private certificate from a third-party provider, you can upload it.                                                                 |
| Upload a public certificate                   | Public certificates aren't used to secure custom domains, but you can load them into your code if you need them to access remote resources.               |

#### Private certificate requirements

The free **App Service managed certificate** and the **App Service certificate** already satisfy the requirements of App Service. If you want to use a private certificate in App Service, your certificate must meet the following requirements:

- Exported as a password-protected PFX file, encrypted using triple DES.
- Contains private key at least 2,048 bits long.
- Contains all intermediate certificates and the root certificate in the certificate chain.

To secure a custom domain in a TLS binding, the certificate has other requirements:

- Contains an Extended Key Usage for server authentication (OID = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1)
- Signed by a trusted certificate authority

#### Creating a free managed certificate

To create custom TLS/SSL bindings or enable client certificates for your App Service app, your App Service plan must be in the **Basic**, **Standard**, **Premium**, or **Isolated** tier.

The free App Service managed certificate is a turn-key solution for securing your custom DNS name in App Service. It's a TLS/SSL server certificate fully managed by App Service and renewed continuously and automatically in six-month increments, 45 days before expiration. You create the certificate and bind it to a custom domain, and let App Service do the rest.

:bangbang: Before you create a free managed certificate, make sure you meet the prerequisites for your app. Free certificates are issued by DigiCert. For some domains, you must explicitly allow DigiCert as a certificate issuer by creating a CAA domain record with the value: `0 issue digicert.com`. Azure fully manages the certificates on your behalf, so any aspect of the managed certificate, including the root issuer, can change at any time. These changes are outside your control. Make sure to avoid hard dependencies and "pinning" practice certificates to the managed certificate or any part of the certificate hierarchy.

The free certificate comes with the following limitations:

- Doesn't support wildcard certificates.
- Doesn't support usage as a client certificate by using certificate thumbprint, which is planned for deprecation and removal.
- Doesn't support private DNS.
- Isn't exportable.
- Isn't supported in an App Service Environment (ASE).
- Only supports alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), and periods (.).
- Only custom domains of length up to 64 characters are supported.

#### Import an App Service Certificate

If you purchase an App Service Certificate from Azure, Azure manages the following tasks:

- Takes care of the purchase process from certificate provider.
- Performs domain verification of the certificate.
- Maintains the certificate in Azure Key Vault.
- Manages certificate renewal.
- Synchronize the certificate automatically with the imported copies in App Service apps.

If you already have a working App Service certificate, you can:

- Import the certificate into App Service.
- Manage the certificate, such as renew, rekey, and export it.

:information_source: App Service Certificates aren't supported in Azure National Clouds at this time.

## Scale apps in Azure App Service

Autoscaling enables a system to adjust the resources required to meet the varying demand from users, while controlling the costs associated with these resources. You can use autoscaling with many Azure services, including web applications. Autoscaling requires you to configure autoscale rules that specify the conditions under which resources should be added or removed.

### Examine autoscale factors

Azure App Service supports manual scaling, and two options for scaling out your web apps automatically:

- Autoscaling with Azure _autoscale_. Autoscaling makes scaling decisions based on rules that you define.
- Azure App Service _automatic scaling_. Automatic scaling makes scaling decisions for you based on the parameters that you select.

The following table highlights the differences between the two automatic scaling options:

| **Factor**                  | **Autoscale**                                                                                                                      | **Automatic scaling**                                                                                    |

#### What is autoscaling?

Autoscaling is a cloud system or process that adjusts available resources based on the current demand. Autoscaling performs scaling _in and out_, as opposed to scaling _up and down_.

Autoscaling can be triggered according to a schedule, or by assessing whether the system is running short on resources. For example, autoscaling could be triggered if CPU utilization grows, memory occupancy increases, the number of incoming requests to a service appears to be surging, or some combination of factors.

#### Azure App Service autoscaling

Autoscaling in Azure App Service monitors the resource metrics of a web app as it runs. It detects situations where other resources are required to handle an increasing workload, and ensures those resources are available before the system becomes overloaded.

Autoscaling responds to changes in the environment by adding or removing web servers and balancing the load between them. Autoscaling doesn't have any effect on the CPU power, memory, or storage capacity of the web servers powering the app, it only changes the number of web servers.

##### Autoscaling rules

Autoscaling makes its decisions based on rules that you define. A rule specifies the threshold for a metric, and triggers an autoscale event when this threshold is crossed. Autoscaling can also deallocate resources when the workload lessens.

Define your autoscaling rules carefully. For example, a Denial of Service attack can result in a large-scale influx of incoming traffic. Trying to handle a surge in requests caused by a DoS attack would be fruitless and expensive. These requests aren't genuine, and should be discarded rather than processed. A better solution is to implement detection and filtering of requests that occur during such an attack before they reach your service.

##### When should you consider autoscaling?

Autoscaling provides elasticity for your services. For example, you might expect increased/reduced activity for a business app during holidays.

Autoscaling improves availability and fault tolerance. It can help ensure that client requests to a service aren't denied because an instance is either: not able to acknowledge the request in a timely manner; or because an instance has crashed.

Autoscaling works by adding or removing web servers. If your web apps perform resource-intensive processing as part of each request, then autoscaling might not be an effective approach. In these situations, manually scaling up may be necessary. For example, if a request sent to a web app involves performing complex processing over a large dataset, depending on the instance size, this single request could exhaust the processing and memory capacity of the instance.

Autoscaling isn't the best approach to handling long-term growth. You might have a web app that starts with a few users, but increases in popularity over time. Autoscaling has an overhead associated with monitoring resources and determining whether to trigger a scaling event. In this scenario, if you can anticipate the rate of growth, manually scaling the system over time may be a more cost effective approach.

The number of instances of a service is also a factor. You might expect to run only a few instances of a service most of the time. However, in this situation, your service is susceptible to downtime or lack of availability whether autoscaling is enabled or not. The fewer the number of instances initially, the less capacity you have to handle an increasing workload while autoscaling spins up more instances.

#### Azure App Service automatic scaling

You enable automatic scaling for an App Service Plan and configure a range of instances for each of the web apps. As your web app starts receiving HTTP traffic, App Service monitors the load and adds instances. Resources may be shared when multiple web apps within an App Service Plan are required to scale out simultaneously.

Here are a few scenarios where you should scale out automatically:

- You don't want to set up autoscale rules based on resource metrics.
- You want your web apps within the same App Service Plan to scale differently and independently of each other.
- Your web app is connected to a database or legacy system, which may not scale as fast as the web app. Scaling automatically allows you to set the maximum number of instances your App Service Plan can scale to. This setting helps the web app to not overwhelm the backend.

### Identify autoscale factors

Autoscaling enables you to specify the conditions under which a web app should be scaled out, and back in again. Effective autoscaling ensures sufficient resources are available to handle large volumes of requests at peak times, while managing costs when the demand drops.

You can configure autoscaling to detect when to scale in and out according to a combination of factors, based on resource usage. You can also configure autoscaling to occur according to a schedule.

In this unit, you learn how to specify the factors that can be used to autoscale a service.

#### Autoscaling and the App Service Plan

Autoscaling is a feature of the App Service Plan used by the web app. When the web app scales out, Azure starts new instances of the hardware defined by the App Service Plan to the app.

To prevent runaway autoscaling, an App Service Plan has an instance limit. Plans in more expensive pricing tiers have a higher limit. Autoscaling can't create more instances than this limit.

:information_source: Not all App Service Plan pricing tiers support autoscaling.

#### Autoscale conditions

You indicate how to autoscale by creating autoscale conditions. Azure provides two options for autoscaling:

- Scale based on a metric, such as the length of the disk queue, or the number of HTTP requests awaiting processing.
- Scale to a specific instance count according to a schedule. For example, you can arrange to scale out at a particular time of day, or on a specific date or day of the week. You also specify an end date, and the system scales back in at this time.

Scaling to a specific instance count only enables you to scale out to a defined number of instances. If you need to scale out incrementally, you can combine metric and schedule-based autoscaling in the same autoscale condition. So, you could arrange for the system to scale out if the number of HTTP requests exceeds some threshold, but only between certain hours of the day.

You can create multiple autoscale conditions to handle different schedules and metrics. Azure autoscales your service when any of these conditions apply. An App Service Plan also has a default condition that is used if none of the other conditions are applicable. This condition is always active and doesn't have a schedule.

#### Metrics for autoscale rules

Autoscaling by metric requires that you define one or more autoscale rules. An autoscale rule specifies a metric to monitor, and how autoscaling should respond when this metric crosses a defined threshold. The metrics you can monitor for a web app are:

- **CPU Percentage**. This metric is an indication of the CPU utilization across all instances. A high value shows that instances are becoming CPU-bound, which could cause delays in processing client requests.
- **Memory Percentage**. This metric captures the memory occupancy of the application across all instances. A high value indicates that free memory could be running low, and could cause one or more instances to fail.
- **Disk Queue Length**. This metric is a measure of the number of outstanding I/O requests across all instances. A high value means that disk contention could be occurring.
- **Http Queue Length**. This metric shows how many client requests are waiting for processing by the web app. If this number is large, client requests might fail with HTTP 408 (Timeout) errors.
- **Data In**. This metric is the number of bytes received across all instances.
- **Data Out**. This metric is the number of bytes sent by all instances.

You can also scale based on metrics for other Azure services.

#### How an autoscale rule analyzes metrics

Autoscaling works by analyzing trends in metric values over time across all instances. Analysis is a multi-step process.

In the first step, an autoscale rule aggregates the values retrieved for a metric for all instances across a period of time known as the _time grain_. Each metric has its own intrinsic _time grain_, but in most cases this period is 1 minute. The aggregated value is known as the _time aggregation_. The options available are _Average_, _Minimum_, _Maximum_, _Sum_, _Last_, and _Count_.

An interval of one minute is a short interval in which to determine whether any change in metric is long-lasting enough to make autoscaling worthwhile. So, an autoscale rule performs a second step that performs a further aggregation of the value calculated by the _time aggregation_ over a longer, user-specified period, known as the _Duration_. The minimum _Duration_ is 5 minutes. If the _Duration_ is set to 10 minutes for example, the autoscale rule aggregates the 10 values calculated for the _time grain_.

The aggregation calculation for the _Duration_ can be different from the _time grain_. For example, if the _time aggregation_ is _Average_ and the statistic gathered is _CPU Percentage_ across a one-minute _time grain_, each minute the average CPU percentage utilization across all instances for that minute is calculated. If the _time grain statistic_ is set to _Maximum_, and the _Duration_ of the rule is set to 10 minutes, the maximum of the 10 average values for the CPU percentage utilization is to determine if the rule threshold was crossed.

#### Autoscale actions

When an autoscale rule detects that a metric crossed a threshold, it can perform an autoscale action. An autoscale action can be _scale-out_ or _scale-in_. A scale-out action increases the number of instances, and a scale-in action reduces the instance count. An autoscale action uses an operator (such as _less than_, _greater than_, _equal to_, and so on) to determine how to react to the threshold. Scale-out actions typically use the _greater than_ operator to compare the metric value to the threshold. Scale-in actions tend to compare the metric value to the threshold with the _less than_ operator. An autoscale action can also set the instance count to a specific level, rather than incrementing or decrementing the number available.

An autoscale action has a _cool down_ period, specified in minutes. During this interval, the scale rule can't be triggered again. This is to allow the system to stabilize between autoscale events. Remember that it takes time to start up or shut down instances, and so any metrics gathered might not show any significant changes for several minutes. The minimum cool down period is five minutes.

#### Pairing autoscale rules

You should plan for scaling-in when a workload decreases. Consider defining autoscale rules in pairs in the same autoscale condition. One autoscale rule should indicate how to scale the system out when a metric exceeds an upper threshold. Then other rule should define how to scale the system back in again when the same metric drops below a lower threshold.

#### Combining autoscale rules

A single autoscale condition can contain several autoscale rules (for example, a scale-out rule and the corresponding scale-in rule). However, the autoscale rules in an autoscale condition don't have to be directly related. You could define the following four rules in the same autoscale condition:

- If the HTTP queue length exceeds 10, scale out by 1
- If the CPU utilization exceeds 70%, scale out by 1
- If the HTTP queue length is zero, scale in by 1
- If the CPU utilization drops below 50%, scale in by 1

When determining whether to scale out, the autoscale action is performed if **any** of the scale-out rules are met (HTTP queue length exceeds 10 **or** CPU utilization exceeds 70%). When scaling in, the autoscale action runs **only if all** of the scale-in rules are met (HTTP queue length drops to zero **and** CPU utilization falls below 50%). If you need to scale in if only one of the scale-in rules are met, you must define the rules in separate autoscale conditions.

### Enable autoscale in App Service

In this unit, you learn how to enable autoscaling, create autoscale rules, and monitor autoscaling activity

#### Enable autoscale

Get started with autoscaling by navigating to your App Service plan in the Azure portal and select **Scale out (App Service plan)** in the **Settings** group in the left navigation pane. Select **Rules Based** in the **Scale out method** section of the page, and then select **Configure**.

:information_source: Not all pricing tiers support autoscaling. The development pricing tiers are either limited to a single instance (the **F1** and **D1** tiers), or they only provide manual scaling (the **B1** tier). If you selected one of these tiers, you must first scale up to the **S1** or any of the **P** level production tiers.

By default, an App Service Plan only implements manual scaling. Selecting **Custom autoscale** reveals condition groups you can use to manage your scale settings.

![Screenshot showing the Custom autoscale selection.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/scale-apps-app-service/media/enable-autoscale.png)

#### Add scale conditions

Once you enable autoscaling, you can edit the automatically created default scale condition, and you can add your own custom scale conditions. Remember that each scale condition can either scale based on a metric, or scale to a specific instance count.

The Default scale condition is executed when none of the other scale conditions are active.

![Screenshot of the condition page for an App Service Plan showing the default scale condition.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/scale-apps-app-service/media/autoscale-conditions.png)

A metric-based scale condition can also specify the minimum and maximum number of instances to create. The maximum number can't exceed the limits defined by the pricing tier. Additionally, all scale conditions other than the default may include a schedule indicating when the condition should be applied.

#### Create scale rules

A metric-based scale condition contains one or more scale rules. You use the **Add a rule** link to add your own custom rules. You define:

- The criteria that indicate when a rule should trigger an autoscale action.
- The autoscale action to be performed.

![Screenshot of the scale rule settings pane.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/scale-apps-app-service/media/autoscale-rules.png)

#### Monitor autoscaling activity

The Azure portal enables you to track when autoscaling occurred through the **Run history** chart. This chart shows how the number of instances varies over time, and which autoscale conditions caused each change.

![Screenshot of the Run history information for the app.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/scale-apps-app-service/media/autoscale-run-history.png)

You can use the **Run history** chart with the metrics shown on the **Overview** page to correlate the autoscaling events with resource utilization.

![Screenshot of the metrics shown on the App Service Plan overview page.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/scale-apps-app-service/media/service-plan-metrics.png)

### Explore autoscale best practices

If you're not following good practices when creating autoscale settings, you can create conditions that lead to undesirable results. In this unit, you learn how to avoid creating rules that conflict with each other.

#### Autoscale concepts

- An autoscale setting scales instances horizontally, which is _out_ by increasing the instances and _in_ by decreasing the number of instances. An autoscale setting has a maximum, minimum, and default value of instances.
- An autoscale job always reads the associated metric to scale by, checking if it crossed the configured threshold for scale-out or scale-in.
- All thresholds are calculated at an instance level. For example, "scale out by one instance when average CPU > 80% when instance count is 2", means to scale out when the average CPU across all instances is greater than 80%.
- All autoscale successes and failures are logged to the Activity Log. You can then configure an activity log alert so that you can be notified via email, short message service, or webhooks whenever there's activity.

#### Autoscale best practices

Use the following best practices as you create your autoscale rules.

##### Ensure the maximum and minimum values are different and have an adequate margin between them

If you have a setting that has minimum=two, maximum=two and the current instance count is two, no scale action can occur. Keep an adequate margin between the maximum and minimum instance counts, which are inclusive. Autoscale always scales between these limits.

##### Choose the appropriate statistic for your diagnostics metric

For diagnostics metrics, you can choose among _Average_, _Minimum_, _Maximum_ and _Total_ as a metric to scale by. The most common statistic is _Average_.

##### Choose the thresholds carefully for all metric types

We recommend carefully choosing different thresholds for scale-out and scale-in based on practical situations.

We _don't recommend_ autoscale settings like the following examples with the same or similar threshold values for out and in conditions:

- Increase instances by one count when Thread Count >= 600
- Decrease instances by one count when Thread Count <= 600

Let's look at an example of what can lead to a behavior that might seem confusing. Consider the following sequence.

1. Assume there are two instances to begin with and then the average number of threads per instance grows to 625.
1. Autoscale scales out adding a third instance.
1. Next, assume that the average thread count across instance falls to 575.
1. Before scaling in, autoscale tries to estimate the final state if it scaled in. For example, 575 x 3 (current instance count) = 1,725 / 2 (final number of instances when scaled in) = 862.5 threads. This means autoscale would have to immediately scale out again even after it scaled in, if the average thread count remains the same or even falls only a small amount. However, if it scaled out again, the whole process would repeat, leading to an infinite loop.
1. To avoid this situation (termed "flapping"), autoscale doesn't scale in at all. Instead, it skips and reevaluates the condition again the next time the service's job executes.

Estimation during a scale-in is intended to avoid "flapping" situations, where scale-in and scale out actions continually go back and forth. Keep this behavior in mind when you choose the same thresholds for scale-out and in.

We recommend choosing an adequate margin between the scale-out and in thresholds. As an example, consider the following better rule combination.

- Increase instances by one count when CPU% >= 80
- Decrease instances by one count when CPU% <= 60

In this case

1. Assume you're starting with two instances.
1. If the average CPU% across instances goes to 80, autoscale scales out adding a third instance.
1. Now assume that over time the CPU% falls to 60.
1. Autoscale's scale-in rule estimates the final state if it were to scale-in. For example, 60 x 3 (current instance count) = 180 / 2 (final number of instances when scaled in) = 90. So autoscale doesn't scale-in because it would have to scale out again immediately. Instead, it skips scaling in.
1. The next time autoscale checks, the CPU continues to fall to 50. It estimates again - 50 x 3 instance = 150 / 2 instances = 75, which is below the scale-out threshold of 80, so it scales in successfully to 2 instances.

##### Considerations for scaling when multiple rules are configured in a profile

There are cases where you might have to set multiple rules in a profile. The following set of autoscale rules are used by services when multiple rules are set.

On _scale-out_, autoscale runs if any rule is met. On _scale-in_, autoscale requires all rules to be met.

To illustrate, assume that you have the following four autoscale rules:

- If CPU < 30%, scale-in by 1
- If Memory < 50%, scale-in by 1
- If CPU > 75%, scale out by 1
- If Memory > 75%, scale out by 1

Then the following occurs:

- If CPU is 76% and Memory is 50%, we scale out.
- If CPU is 50% and Memory is 76% we scale out.

On the other hand, if CPU is 25% and memory is 51% autoscale doesn't scale-in. An automatic scale-in would occur if the CPU is 29% and the Memory is 49% since both of the scale-in rules would be true.

##### Always select a safe default instance count

The default instance count is important because autoscale scales your service to that count when metrics aren't available. Therefore, select a default instance count that's safe for your workloads.

##### Configure autoscale notifications

Autoscale posts to the Activity Log if any of the following conditions occur:

- Autoscale issues a scale operation
- Autoscale service successfully completes a scale action
- Autoscale service fails to take a scale action.
- Metrics aren't available for autoscale service to make a scale decision.
- Metrics are available (recovery) again to make a scale decision.

You can also use an Activity Log alert to monitor the health of the autoscale engine. In addition to using activity log alerts, you can also configure email or webhook notifications to get notified for successful scale actions via the notifications tab on the autoscale setting.

## Explore Azure App Service deployment slots

The deployment slot functionality in App Service is a powerful tool that enables you to preview, manage, test, and deploy your different development environments.

### Explore staging environments

When you deploy your web app, web app on Linux, mobile back end, or API app to Azure App Service, you can use a separate deployment slot instead of the default production slot. This approach is available if you run in the **Standard**, **Premium**, or **Isolated** App Service plan tier. Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names. App content and configurations elements can be swapped between two deployment slots, including the production slot.

Deploying your application to a nonproduction slot has the following benefits:

- You can validate app changes in a staging deployment slot before swapping it with the production slot.
- Deploy an app to a slot first and swapping it into production makes sure that all instances of the slot are warmed up before being swapped into production. This eliminates downtime when you deploy your app. The traffic redirection is seamless, and no requests are dropped because of swap operations. You can automate this entire workflow by configuring auto swap when pre-swap validation isn't needed.
- After a swap, the previous production app is located in the staging slot. If the changes swapped into the production slot aren't as you expect, you can perform the same swap immediately to get your "last known good site" back.

Each App Service plan tier supports a different number of deployment slots. There's no extra charge for using deployment slots. To find out the number of slots your app's tier supports, visit [App Service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#app-service-limits).

To scale your app to a different tier, make sure that the target tier supports the number of slots your app already uses. For example, if your app has more than five slots, you can't scale it down to the **Standard** tier, because the **Standard** tier supports only five deployment slots.

When you create a new deployment slot the new slot has no content, even if you clone the settings from a different slot. You can deploy to the slot from a different repository branch or a different repository.

The slot's URL has the format `http://sitename-slotname.azurewebsites.net`. To keep the URL length within necessary domain name system limits, the site name is truncated at 40 characters. The combined site name and slot name must be fewer than 59 characters.

### Examine slot swapping

When you swap two slots, App Service completes the following process to ensure that the target slot doesn't experience downtime:

1. Apply the following settings from the target slot (for example, the production slot) to all instances of the source slot:

   - Slot-specific app settings and connection strings, if applicable.
   - Continuous deployment settings, if enabled.
   - App Service authentication settings, if enabled.

   When any of the settings is applied to the source slot, the change triggers all instances in the source slot to restart. During **swap with preview**, this marks the end of the first phase. The swap operation is paused, and you can validate that the source slot works correctly with the target slot's settings.

1. Wait for every instance in the source slot to complete its restart. If any instance fails to restart, the swap operation reverts all changes to the source slot and stops the operation.

1. If local cache is enabled, trigger local cache initialization by making an HTTP request to the application root ("/") on each instance of the source slot. Wait until each instance returns any HTTP response. Local cache initialization causes another restart on each instance.

1. If auto swap is enabled with custom warm-up, trigger Application Initiation by making an HTTP request to the application root ("/") on each instance of the source slot.

   - If `applicationInitialization` isn't specified, trigger an HTTP request to the application root of the source slot on each instance.

   - An instance is considered warmed up if it returns any HTTP response.

1. If all instances on the source slot are warmed up successfully, swap the two slots by switching the routing rules for the two slots. After this step, the target slot (for example, the production slot) has the app previously warmed up in the source slot.

1. Now that the source slot has the pre-swap app previously in the target slot, perform the same operation by applying all settings and restarting the instances.

At any point of the swap operation, all work of initializing the swapped apps happens on the source slot. The target slot remains online while the source slot is being prepared and warmed up, regardless of where the swap succeeds or fails. To swap a staging slot with the production slot, make sure that the production slot is always the target slot. This way, the swap operation doesn't affect your production app.

When you clone configuration from another deployment slot, the cloned configuration is editable. Some configuration elements follow the content across a swap (not slot specific), whereas other configuration elements stay in the same slot after a swap (slot specific). The following table shows the settings that change when you swap slots.

| Settings that are swapped                                           | Settings that aren't swapped                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| General settings, such as framework version, 32/64-bit, web sockets | Publishing endpoints                                    |
| App settings (can be configured to stick to a slot)                 | Custom domain names                                     |
| Connection strings (can be configured to stick to a slot)           | Nonpublic certificates and TLS/SSL settings             |
| Handler mappings                                                    | Scale settings                                          |
| Public certificates                                                 | WebJobs schedulers                                      |
| WebJobs content                                                     | IP restrictions                                         |
| Hybrid connections                                                  | Always On                                               |
| Azure Content Delivery Network                                      | Diagnostic log settings                                 |
| Service endpoints                                                   | Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)                    |
| Path mappings                                                       | Virtual network integration                             |
|                                                                     | Managed identities                                      |
|                                                                     | Settings that end with the suffix `\_EXTENSION_VERSION` |

:information_source: To make settings swappable, add the app setting `WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_PRESERVE_DEFAULT_STICKY_SLOT_SETTINGS` in every slot of the app and set its value to `0` or `false`. These settings are either all swappable or not at all. You can't make just some settings swappable and not the others. Managed identities are never swapped and aren't affected by this override app setting.

To configure an app setting or connection string to stick to a specific slot (not swapped), go to the Configuration page for that slot. Add or edit a setting, and then select **Deployment slot setting**. Selecting this check box tells App Service that the setting isn't swappable.

### Swap deployment slots

You can swap deployment slots on your app's Deployment slots page and the Overview page. Before you swap an app from a deployment slot into production, make sure that production is your target slot and that all settings in the source slot are configured exactly as you want to have them in production.

#### Manually swapping deployment slots

To swap deployment slots:

1. Go to your app's **Deployment slots** page and select **Swap**. The **Swap** dialog box shows settings in the selected source and target slots that are changed.

1. Select the desired **Source** and **Target** slots. Usually, the target is the production slot. Also, select the **Source Changes** and **Target Changes** tabs and verify that the configuration changes are expected. When you're finished, you can swap the slots immediately by selecting **Swap**.

   To see how your target slot would run with the new settings before the swap actually happens, don't select Swap, but follow the instructions in _Swap with preview_.

1. When you're finished, close the dialog box by selecting **Close**.

##### Swap with preview (multi-phase swap)

Before you swap into production as the target slot, validate that the app runs with the swapped settings. The source slot is also warmed up before the swap completion, which is desirable for mission-critical applications.

When you perform a swap with preview, App Service performs the same swap operation but pauses after the first step. You can then verify the result on the staging slot before completing the swap.

If you cancel the swap, App Service reapplies configuration elements to the source slot.

To swap with preview:

1. Follow the steps in Swap deployment slots section, but select the **Perform swap with preview** checkbox. The dialog box shows you how the configuration in the source slot changes in phase 1, and how the source and target slot change in phase 2.

1. When you're ready to start the swap, select **Start Swap**.

   When phase 1 finishes, you're notified in the dialog box. Preview the swap in the source slot by going to `https://<app_name>-<source-slot-name>.azurewebsites.net.`

1. When you're ready to complete the pending swap, select **Complete Swap** in **Swap action** and select **Complete Swap**.

   To cancel a pending swap, select **Cancel Swap** instead.

1. When you're finished, close the dialog box by selecting **Close**.

#### Configure auto swap

Auto swap streamlines Azure DevOps Services scenarios where you want to deploy your app continuously with zero cold starts and zero downtime for customers of the app. When auto swap is enabled from a slot into production, every time you push your code changes to that slot, App Service automatically swaps the app into production after the source slot is warmed up.

:information_source: Auto swap isn't currently supported in web apps on Linux and Web App for Containers.

To configure auto swap:

1. Go to your app's resource page and select the deployment slot you want to configure to auto swap. The setting is on the **Configuration** > **General settings** page.

1. Set **Auto swap enabled** to **On**. Then select the desired target slot for **Auto swap deployment slot**, and select **Save** on the command bar.

1. Execute a code push to the source slot. Auto swap happens after a short time, and the update is reflected at your target slot's URL.

#### Specify custom warm-up

Some apps might require custom warm-up actions before the swap. The `applicationInitialization` configuration element in web.config lets you specify custom initialization actions. The swap operation waits for this custom warm-up to finish before swapping with the target slot. Here's a sample web.config fragment.

```xml
<system.webServer>
  <applicationInitialization>
    <add initializationPage="/" hostName="[app hostname]" />
    <add initializationPage="/Home/About" hostName="[app hostname]" />
  </applicationInitialization>
</system.webServer>
```

For more information on customizing the `applicationInitialization` element, see [Most common deployment slot swap failures and how to fix them](https://ruslany.net/2017/11/most-common-deployment-slot-swap-failures-and-how-to-fix-them/).

You can also customize the warm-up behavior with one or both of the following app settings:

- `WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH`: The path to ping to warm up your site. Add this app setting by specifying a custom path that begins with a slash as the value. An example is `/statuscheck`. The default value is `/`.
- `WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES`: Valid HTTP response codes for the warm-up operation. Add this app setting with a comma-separated list of HTTP codes. An example is `200,202`. If the returned status code isn't in the list, the warmup and swap operations are stopped. By default, all response codes are valid.
- `WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH`: A relative path on the site that should be pinged whenever the site restarts (not only during slot swaps). Example values include `/statuscheck` or the root path, `/`.

#### Roll back and monitor a swap

If any errors occur in the target slot (for example, the production slot) after a slot swap, restore the slots to their pre-swap states by swapping the same two slots immediately.

If the swap operation takes a long time to complete, you can get information on the swap operation in the activity log.

1. On your app's resource page in the portal, in the left pane, select **Activity log**.

1. A swap operation appears in the log query as **Swap Web App Slots**. You can expand it and select one of the suboperations or errors to see the details.

### Route traffic in App Service

By default, all client requests to the app's production URL (`http://<app_name>.azurewebsites.net`) are routed to the production slot. You can route a portion of the traffic to another slot. This feature is useful if you need user feedback for a new update, but you're not ready to release it to production.

#### Route production traffic automatically

To route production traffic automatically:

1. Go to your app's resource page and select **Deployment slots**.

1. In the **Traffic** % column of the slot you want to route to, specify a percentage (between 0 and 100) to represent the amount of total traffic you want to route. Select **Save**.

After the setting is saved, the specified percentage of clients is randomly routed to the nonproduction slot.

After a client is automatically routed to a specific slot, it's "pinned" to that slot for the life of that client session. On the client browser, you can see which slot your session is pinned to by looking at the `x-ms-routing-name` cookie in your HTTP headers. A request routed to the "staging" slot has the cookie `x-ms-routing-name=staging`. A request routed to the production slot has the cookie `x-ms-routing-name=self`.

#### Route production traffic manually

In addition to automatic traffic routing, App Service can route requests to a specific slot. This is useful when you want your users to be able to opt in to or opt out of your beta app. To route production traffic manually, you use the `x-ms-routing-name` query parameter.

To let users opt out of your beta app, for example, you can put this link on your webpage:

```html
<a href="<webappname>.azurewebsites.net/?x-ms-routing-name=self">
  Go back to production app
</a>
```

The string `x-ms-routing-name=self` specifies the production slot. The client browser is redirected production slot after accessing the link. Every subsequent request has the `x-ms-routing-name=self` cookie that pins the session to the production slot.

Enable users opt in to your beta app, set the same query parameter to the name of the nonproduction slot. Here's an example:

```xml
<webappname>.azurewebsites.net/?x-ms-routing-name=staging</webappname>
```

New slots are given a routing rule of `0%` by default. Default values are displayed in grey. When you explicitly set the routing rule value to `0%` the value is displayed in black, your users can access the staging slot manually by using the `x-ms-routing-name` query parameter. They aren't routed to the slot automatically because the routing percentage is set to 0. This is an advanced scenario where you can "hide" your staging slot from the public while allowing internal teams to test changes on the slot.
