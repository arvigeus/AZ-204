# API Management

## Explore API Management

API Management helps organizations publish APIs to external, partner, and internal developers to unlock the potential of their data and services.

### Discover the API Management service

API Management provides the core functionality to ensure a successful API program through developer engagement, business insights, analytics, security, and protection. Each API consists of one or more operations, and each API can be added to one or more products. To use an API, developers subscribe to a product that contains that API, and then they can call the API's operation, subject to any usage policies that might be in effect.

#### API Management components

Azure API Management is made up of an _API gateway_, a _management plane_, and a _developer portal_. These components are Azure-hosted and fully managed by default. API Management is available in various [tiers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-features) differing in capacity and features.

- The **API gateway** is the endpoint that:
  - Accepts API calls and routes them to appropriate backends
  - Verifies API keys and other credentials presented with requests
  - Enforces usage quotas and rate limits
  - Transforms requests and responses specified in policy statements
  - Caches responses to improve response latency and minimize the load on backend services
  - Emits logs, metrics, and traces for monitoring, reporting, and troubleshooting
- The **management plane** is the administrative interface where you set up your API program. Use it to:
  - Provision and configure API Management service settings
  - Define or import API schema
  - Package APIs into products
  - Set up policies like quotas or transformations on the APIs
  - Get insights from analytics
  - Manage users
- The **Developer portal** is an automatically generated, fully customizable website with the documentation of your APIs. Using the developer portal, developers can:
  - Read API documentation
  - Call an API via the interactive console
  - Create an account and subscribe to get API keys
  - Access analytics on their own usage
  - Download API definitions
  - Manage API keys

#### Products

Products are how APIs are surfaced to developers. Products in API Management have one or more APIs, and are configured with a title, description, and terms of use. Products can be **Open** or **Protected**. Protected products must be subscribed to before they can be used, while open products can be used without a subscription. Subscription approval is configured at the product level and can either require administrator approval, or be autoapproved.

#### Groups

Groups are used to manage the visibility of products to developers. API Management has the following immutable system groups:

- **Administrators** - Manage API Management service instances and create the APIs, operations, and products that are used by developers. Azure subscription administrators are members of this group.
- **Developers** - Authenticated developer portal users that build applications using your APIs. Developers are granted access to the developer portal and build applications that call the operations of an API.
- **Guests** - Unauthenticated developer portal users. They can be granted certain read-only access, like the ability to view APIs but not call them.

In addition to these system groups, administrators can create custom groups or use external groups in associated Microsoft Entra tenants.

#### Developers

Developers represent the user accounts in an API Management service instance. Developers can be created or invited to join by administrators, or they can sign up from the Developer portal. Each developer is a member of one or more groups, and can subscribe to the products that grant visibility to those groups.

#### Policies

Policies are a collection of statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API. Popular statements include format conversion from XML to JSON and call rate limiting to restrict the number of incoming calls from a developer, and many other policies are available.

Policy expressions can be used as attribute values or text values in any of the API Management policies, unless the policy specifies otherwise. Some policies such as the Control flow and Set variable policies are based on policy expressions.

Policies can be applied at different scopes, depending on your needs: global (all APIs), a product, a specific API, or an API operation.

### Explore API gateways

Your solution may contain several front- and back-end services. In this scenario, how does a client know what endpoints to call? What happens when new services are introduced, or existing services are refactored? How do services handle SSL termination, authentication, and other concerns?

The API Management gateway (also called data plane or runtime) is the service component that's responsible for proxying API requests, applying policies, and collecting telemetry.

An API gateway sits between clients and services. It acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests from clients to services. It may also perform various cross-cutting tasks such as authentication, SSL termination, and rate limiting. If you don't deploy a gateway, clients must send requests directly to back-end services. However, there are some potential problems with exposing services directly to clients:

- It can result in complex client code. The client must keep track of multiple endpoints, and handle failures in a resilient way.
- It creates coupling between the client and the backend. The client needs to know how the individual services are decomposed. That makes it harder to maintain the client and also harder to refactor services.
- A single operation might require calls to multiple services.
- Each public-facing service must handle concerns such as authentication, SSL, and client rate limiting.
- Services must expose a client-friendly protocol such as HTTP or WebSocket. This limits the choice of communication protocols.
- Services with public endpoints are a potential attack surface, and must be hardened.

A gateway helps to address these issues by decoupling clients from services.

#### Managed and self-hosted

API Management offers both managed and self-hosted gateways:

- **Managed** - The managed gateway is the default gateway component that is deployed in Azure for every API Management instance in every service tier. With the managed gateway, all API traffic flows through Azure regardless of where backends implementing the APIs are hosted.
- **Self-hosted** - The self-hosted gateway is an optional, containerized version of the default managed gateway. It's useful for hybrid and multicloud scenarios where there's a requirement to run the gateways off of Azure in the same environments where API backends are hosted. The self-hosted gateway enables customers with hybrid IT infrastructure to manage APIs hosted on-premises and across clouds from a single API Management service in Azure.

### Explore API Management policies

In Azure API Management, policies allow the publisher to change the behavior of the API through configuration. Policies are a collection of Statements that are executed sequentially on the request or response of an API.

Policies are applied inside the gateway that sits between the API consumer and the managed API. The gateway receives all requests and usually forwards them unaltered to the underlying API. However a policy can apply changes to both the inbound request and outbound response. Policy expressions can be used as attribute values or text values in any of the API Management policies, unless the policy specifies otherwise.

#### Understanding policy configuration

The policy definition is a simple XML document that describes a sequence of inbound and outbound statements. The XML can be edited directly in the definition window.

The configuration is divided into `inbound`, `backend`, `outbound`, and `on-error`. The series of specified policy statements is executed in order for a request and a response.

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the request go here -->
  </inbound>
  <backend>
    <!-- statements to be applied before the request is forwarded to
         the backend service go here -->
  </backend>
  <outbound>
    <!-- statements to be applied to the response go here -->
  </outbound>
  <on-error>
    <!-- statements to be applied if there is an error condition go here -->
  </on-error>
</policies>
```

If there's an error during the processing of a request, any remaining steps in the `inbound`, `backend`, or `outbound` sections are skipped and execution jumps to the statements in the `on-error` section. By placing policy statements in the `on-error` section you can review the error by using the `context.LastError` property, inspect and customize the error response using the `set-body` policy, and configure what happens if an error occurs.

#### Policy expressions

Unless the policy specifies otherwise, policy expressions can be used as attribute values or text values in any of the API Management policies. A policy expression is either:

- a single C# statement enclosed in `@(expression)`, or
- a multi-statement C# code block, enclosed in `@{expression}`, that returns a value

Each expression has access to the implicitly provided `context` variable and an allowed subset of .NET Framework types.

[Policy expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-policy-expressions) provide a sophisticated means to control traffic and modify API behavior without requiring you to write specialized code or modify backend services.

The following example uses policy expressions and the set-header policy to add user data to the incoming request. The added header includes the user ID associated with the subscription key in the request, and the region where the gateway processing the request is hosted.

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <base />
        <set-header name="x-request-context-data" exists-action="override">
            <value>@(context.User.Id)</value>
            <value>@(context.Deployment.Region)</value>
      </set-header>
    </inbound>
</policies>
```

#### Apply policies specified at different scopes

If you have a policy at the global level and a policy configured for an API, then whenever that particular API is used both policies are applied. API Management allows for deterministic ordering of combined policy statements via the base element.

```xml
<policies>
    <inbound>
        <cross-domain />
        <base />
        <find-and-replace from="xyz" to="abc" />
    </inbound>
</policies>
```

In the previous example policy definition, The `cross-domain` statement would execute first. The `find-and-replace` policy would execute after any policies at a broader scope.

### Filter response content

The policy defined in following example demonstrates how to filter data elements from the response payload based on the product associated with the request.

The snippet assumes that response content is formatted as JSON and contains root-level properties named _minutely_, _hourly_, _daily_, and _flags_.

```xml
<policies>
  <inbound>
    <base />
  </inbound>
  <backend>
    <base />
  </backend>
  <outbound>
    <base />
    <choose>
      <when condition="@(context.Response.StatusCode == 200 && context.Product.Name.Equals("Starter"))">
        <!-- NOTE that we are not using preserveContent=true when deserializing response body stream into a JSON object since we don't intend to access it again. See details on https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/api-management/api-management-transformation-policies#SetBody -->
        <set-body>
          @{
            var response = context.Response.Body.As<JObject>();
            foreach (var key in new [] {"minutely", "hourly", "daily", "flags"}) {
            response.Property (key).Remove ();
           }
          return response.ToString();
          }
        </set-body>
      </when>
    </choose>
  </outbound>
  <on-error>
    <base />
  </on-error>
</policies>
```

### Create advanced policies

This unit provides a reference for the following API Management policies:

- Control flow - Conditionally applies policy statements based on the results of the evaluation of Boolean expressions.
- Forward request - Forwards the request to the backend service.
- Limit concurrency - Prevents enclosed policies from executing by more than the specified number of requests at a time.
- Log to Event Hub - Sends messages in the specified format to an Event Hub defined by a Logger entity.
- Mock response - Aborts pipeline execution and returns a mocked response directly to the caller.
- Retry - Retries execution of the enclosed policy statements, if and until the condition is met. Execution repeats at the specified time intervals and up to the specified retry count.

#### Control flow

The `choose` policy applies enclosed policy statements based on the outcome of evaluation of boolean expressions, similar to an if-then-else or a switch construct in a programming language.

```xml
<choose>
    <when condition="Boolean expression | Boolean constant">
        <!— one or more policy statements to be applied if the above condition is true  -->
    </when>
    <when condition="Boolean expression | Boolean constant">
        <!— one or more policy statements to be applied if the above condition is true  -->
    </when>
    <otherwise>
        <!— one or more policy statements to be applied if none of the above conditions are true  -->
</otherwise>
</choose>
```

The control flow policy must contain at least one `<when/>` element. The `<otherwise/>` element is optional. Conditions in `<when/>` elements are evaluated in order of their appearance within the policy. Policy statements enclosed within the first `<when/>` element are applied when the condition attribute is true. Policies enclosed within the `<otherwise/>` element, if present, are applied if all of the `<when/>` element condition attributes are false.

#### Forward request

The `forward-request` policy forwards the incoming request to the backend service specified in the request context. The backend service URL is specified in the API settings and can be changed using the set backend service policy.

Removing this policy results in the request not being forwarded to the backend service. The policies in the outbound section are evaluated immediately upon the successful completion of the policies in the inbound section.

```xml
<forward-request timeout="time in seconds" follow-redirects="true | false"/>
```

#### Limit concurrency

The `limit-concurrency` policy prevents enclosed policies from executing by more than the specified number of requests at any time. When requests exceed that number, new requests fail immediately with a _429 Too Many Requests_ status code.

```xml
<limit-concurrency key="expression" max-count="number">
        <!— nested policy statements -->
</limit-concurrency>
```

#### Log to Event Hub

The `log-to-eventhub` policy sends messages in the specified format to an Event Hub defined by a Logger entity. As its name implies, the policy is used for saving selected request or response context information for online or offline analysis.

```xml
<log-to-eventhub logger-id="id of the logger entity" partition-id="index of the partition where messages are sent" partition-key="value used for partition assignment">
  Expression returning a string to be logged
</log-to-eventhub>
```

#### Mock response

The `mock-response`, as the name implies, is used to mock APIs and operations. It aborts normal pipeline execution and returns a mocked response to the caller. The policy always tries to return responses of highest fidelity. It prefers response content examples, whenever available. It generates sample responses from schemas, when schemas are provided and examples aren't. If examples or schemas aren't found, responses with no content are returned.

```xml
<mock-response status-code="code" content-type="media type"/>
```

#### Retry

The `retry` policy executes its child policies once and then retries their execution until the retry `condition` becomes `false` or retry `count` is exhausted.

```xml
<retry
    condition="boolean expression or literal"
    count="number of retry attempts"
    interval="retry interval in seconds"
    max-interval="maximum retry interval in seconds"
    delta="retry interval delta in seconds"
    first-fast-retry="boolean expression or literal">
        <!-- One or more child policies. No restrictions -->
</retry>
```

#### Return response

The `return-response` policy aborts pipeline execution and returns either a default or custom response to the caller. Default response is `200 OK` with no body. Custom response can be specified via a context variable or policy statements. When both are provided, the policy statement modifies the context variable before being returned to the caller.

```xml
<return-response response-variable-name="existing context variable">
  <set-header/>
  <set-body/>
  <set-status/>
</return-response>
```

### Secure APIs by using subscriptions

When you publish APIs through API Management, it's easy and common to secure access to those APIs by using subscription keys. Developers who need to consume the published APIs must include a valid subscription key in HTTP requests when they make calls to those APIs. The API Management gateway rejects calls without a subscription key and the calls aren't forwarded to the back-end services.

To get a subscription key for accessing APIs, a subscription is required. A subscription is essentially a named container for a pair of subscription keys. Developers who need to consume the published APIs can get subscriptions. And they don't need approval from API publishers. API publishers can also create subscriptions directly for API consumers.

:information_source: API Management also supports other mechanisms for securing access to APIs, including: OAuth2.0, Client certificates, and IP allow listing.

#### Subscriptions and Keys

A subscription key is a unique autogenerated key that can be passed through in the headers of the client request or as a query string parameter. The key is directly related to a subscription, which can be scoped to different areas. Subscriptions give you granular control over permissions and policies.

The three main subscription scopes are:

| Scope      | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| All APIs   | Applies to every API accessible from the gateway. This scope provides access to all APIs configured in the API Management service.                                                                                                                                          |
| Single API | This scope applies to a single imported API and all of its endpoints. It allows fine-grained access control and can be used to limit access to specific APIs within the API Management service.                                                                             |
| Product    | A product is a collection of one or more APIs that you configure in API Management. You can assign APIs to more than one product. Products can have different access rules, usage quotas, and terms of use. This scope applies to a specific product within API Management. |

Applications that call a protected API must include the key in every request.

You can regenerate these subscription keys at any time, for example, if you suspect that a key has been shared with unauthorized users.

![Image showing the Subscriptions screen.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-api-management/media/subscription-keys.png)

Every subscription has two keys, a primary and a secondary. Having two keys makes it easier when you do need to regenerate a key. For example, if you want to change the primary key and avoid downtime, use the secondary key in your apps.

For products where subscriptions are enabled, clients must supply a key when making calls to APIs in that product. Developers can obtain a key by submitting a subscription request. If you approve the request, you must send them the subscription key securely, for example, in an encrypted message. This step is a core part of the API Management workflow.

#### Call an API with the subscription key

Applications must include a valid key in all HTTP requests when they make calls to API endpoints that are protected by a subscription. Keys can be passed in the request header, or as a query string in the URL.

The default header name is **Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key**, and the default query string is **subscription-key**.

To test out your API calls, you can use the developer portal, or command-line tools, such as curl. Here's an example of a `GET` request using the developer portal, which shows the subscription key header:

![Call API from developer portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-api-management/media/key-header-portal.png)

Here's how you can pass a key in the request header using **curl**:

```sh
curl --header "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <key string>" https://<apim gateway>.azure-api.net/api/path
```

Here's an example curl command that passes a key in the URL as a query string:

```sh
curl https://<apim gateway>.azure-api.net/api/path?subscription-key=<key string>
```

If the key isn't passed in the header, or as a query string in the URL, you get a **401 Access Denied** response from the API gateway.

### Secure APIs by using certificates

Certificates can be used to provide Transport Layer Security (TLS) mutual authentication between the client and the API gateway. You can configure the API Management gateway to allow only requests with certificates containing a specific thumbprint. The authorization at the gateway level is handled through inbound policies.

#### Transport Layer Security client authentication

With TLS client authentication, the API Management gateway can inspect the certificate contained within the client request and check for properties like:

| Property                   | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Certificate Authority (CA) | Only allow certificates signed by a particular CA    |
| Thumbprint                 | Allow certificates containing a specified thumbprint |
| Subject                    | Only allow certificates with a specified subject     |
| Expiration Date            | Don't allow expired certificates                     |

These properties aren't mutually exclusive and they can be mixed together to form your own policy requirements. For instance, you can specify that the certificate passed in the request is signed and isn't expired.

Client certificates are signed to ensure that they aren't tampered with. When a partner sends you a certificate, verify that it comes from them and not an imposter. There are two common ways to verify a certificate:

- Check who issued the certificate. If the issuer was a certificate authority that you trust, you can use the certificate. You can configure the trusted certificate authorities in the Azure portal to automate this process.
- If the certificate is issued by the partner, verify that it came from them. For example, if they deliver the certificate in person, you can be sure of its authenticity. These are known as self-signed certificates.

#### Accepting client certificates in the Consumption tier

The Consumption tier in API Management is designed to conform with serverless design principals. If you build your APIs from serverless technologies, such as Azure Functions, this tier is a good fit. In the Consumption tier, you must explicitly enable the use of client certificates, which you can do on the **Custom domains** page. This step isn't necessary in other tiers.

![Configure the gateway to request certificates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-api-management/media/configure-request-certificates.png)

#### Certificate Authorization Policies

Create these policies in the inbound processing policy file within the API Management gateway:

![Inbound processing policy button](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/explore-api-management/media/inbound-policy.png)

##### Check the thumbprint of a client certificate

Every client certificate includes a thumbprint, which is a hash, calculated from other certificate properties. The thumbprint ensures that the values in the certificate haven't been altered since the certificate was issued by the certificate authority. You can check the thumbprint in your policy. The following example checks the thumbprint of the certificate passed in the request:

```xml
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || context.Request.Certificate.Thumbprint != "desired-thumbprint")" >
        <return-response>
            <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
        </return-response>
    </when>
</choose>
```

##### Check the thumbprint against certificates uploaded to API Management

In the previous example, only one thumbprint would work so only one certificate would be validated. Usually, each customer or partner company would pass a different certificate with a different thumbprint. To support this scenario, obtain the certificates from your partners and use the **Client certificates** page in the Azure portal to upload them to the API Management resource. Then add this code to your policy:

```xml
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || !context.Request.Certificate.Verify()  || !context.Deployment.Certificates.Any(c => c.Value.Thumbprint == context.Request.Certificate.Thumbprint))" >
        <return-response>
            <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
        </return-response>
    </when>
</choose>
```

##### Check the issuer and subject of a client certificate

This example checks the issuer and subject of the certificate passed in the request:

```xml
<choose>
    <when condition="@(context.Request.Certificate == null || context.Request.Certificate.Issuer != "trusted-issuer" || context.Request.Certificate.SubjectName.Name != "expected-subject-name")" >
        <return-response>
            <set-status code="403" reason="Invalid client certificate" />
        </return-response>
    </when>
</choose>
```
