# Microsoft Graph

## Explore Microsoft Graph

Use the wealth of data in Microsoft Graph to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with millions of users.

### Discover Microsoft Graph

Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. It provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access the tremendous amount of data in Microsoft 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security.

![Microsoft Graph, Microsoft Graph data connect, and Microsoft Graph connectors enable extending Microsoft 365 experiences and building intelligent apps.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/microsoft-graph/media/microsoft-graph-data-connectors.png)

In the Microsoft 365 platform, three main components facilitate the access and flow of data:

- The Microsoft Graph API offers a single endpoint, `https://graph.microsoft.com`. You can use REST APIs or SDKs to access the endpoint. Microsoft Graph also includes services that manage user and device identity, access, compliance, and security.

- [Microsoft Graph connectors](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftsearch/connectors-overview) work in the incoming direction, **delivering data external to the Microsoft cloud into Microsoft Graph services and applications**, to enhance Microsoft 365 experiences such as Microsoft Search. Connectors exist for many commonly used data sources such as Box, Google Drive, Jira, and Salesforce.

- [Microsoft Graph Data Connect](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview#access-microsoft-graph-data-at-scale-using-microsoft-graph-data-connect) provides a set of tools to streamline secure and scalable delivery of **Microsoft Graph data to popular Azure data stores**. The cached data serves as data sources for Azure development tools that you can use to build intelligent applications.

### Query Microsoft Graph by using REST

Microsoft Graph is a RESTful web API that enables you to access Microsoft Cloud service resources. After you register your app and get authentication tokens for a user or service, you can make requests to the Microsoft Graph API.

The Microsoft Graph API defines most of its resources, methods, and enumerations in the OData namespace, `microsoft.graph`, in the [Microsoft Graph metadata](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/traverse-the-graph#microsoft-graph-api-metadata). A few API sets are defined in their sub-namespaces, such as the [call records API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/callrecords-api-overview) which defines resources like [callRecord](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/callrecords-callrecord) in `microsoft.graph.callRecords`.

Unless explicitly specified in the corresponding topic, assume types, methods, and enumerations are part of the `microsoft.graph` namespace.

#### Call a REST API method

To read from or write to a resource such as a user or an email message, construct a request that looks like the following sample:

```http
{HTTP method} https://graph.microsoft.com/{version}/{resource}?{query-parameters}
```

The components of a request include:

- `{HTTP method}` - The HTTP method used on the request to Microsoft Graph.
- `{version}` - The version of the Microsoft Graph API your application is using.
- `{resource}` - The resource in Microsoft Graph that you're referencing.
- `{query-parameters}` - Optional OData query options or REST method parameters that customize the response.

After you make a request, a response is returned that includes:

- Status code - An HTTP status code that indicates success or failure.
- Response message - The data that you requested or the result of the operation. The response message can be empty for some operations.
- `nextLink` - If your request returns a lot of data, you need to page through it by using the URL returned in `@odata.nextLink`.

#### HTTP methods

Microsoft Graph uses the HTTP method on your request to determine what your request is doing. The API supports the following methods.

| Method | Description                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | Read data from a resource.                   |
| POST   | Create a new resource, or perform an action. |
| PATCH  | Update a resource with new values.           |
| PUT    | Replace a resource with a new one.           |
| DELETE | Remove a resource.                           |

- For the CRUD methods `GET` and `DELETE`, no request body is required.
- The `POST`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` methods require a request body specified in JSON format that contains additional information. Such as the values for properties of the resource.

#### Version

Microsoft Graph currently supports two versions: `v1.0` and `beta`.

- `v1.0` includes generally available APIs. Use the v1.0 version for all production apps.
- `beta` includes APIs that are currently in preview. Because we might introduce breaking changes to our beta APIs, we recommend that you use the beta version only to test apps that are in development; don't use beta APIs in your production apps.

#### Resource

A resource can be an entity or complex type, commonly defined with properties. Entities differ from complex types by always including an **id** property.

Your URL includes the resource you're interacting with in the request, such as `me`, **user**, **group**, **drive**, and **site**. Often, top-level resources also include _relationships_, which you can use to access other resources, like `me/messages` or `me/drive`. You can also interact with resources using _methods_; for example, to send an email, use `me/sendMail`.

Each resource might require different permissions to access it. You often need a higher level of permissions to create or update a resource than to read it. For details about required permissions, see the method reference topic.

#### Query parameters

Query parameters can be OData system query options, or other strings that a method accepts to customize its response.

You can use optional OData system query options to include more or fewer properties than the default response. You can filter the response for items that match a custom query, or provide another parameters for a method.

For example, adding the following `filter` parameter restricts the messages returned with the `emailAddress` property of `jon@contoso.com`.

```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?filter=emailAddress eq 'jon@contoso.com'
```

### Query Microsoft Graph by using SDKs

The Microsoft Graph SDKs are designed to simplify building high-quality, efficient, and resilient applications that access Microsoft Graph. The SDKs include two components: a service library and a core library.

The service library contains models and request builders that are generated from Microsoft Graph metadata to provide a rich and discoverable experience.

The core library provides a set of features that enhance working with all the Microsoft Graph services. Embedded support for retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication, and payload compression, improve the quality of your application's interactions with Microsoft Graph, with no added complexity, while leaving you completely in control. The core library also provides support for common tasks such as paging through collections and creating batch requests.

In this unit, you learn about the available SDKs and see some code examples of some of the most common operations.

:information_source: The code samples in this unit are based on version 5.65 of the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK.

#### Install the Microsoft Graph .NET SDK

The Microsoft Graph .NET SDK is included in the following NuGet packages:

- [Microsoft.Graph](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet) - Contains the models and request builders for accessing the `v1.0` endpoint with the fluent API. Microsoft.Graph has a dependency on Microsoft.Graph.Core.
- [Microsoft.Graph.Beta](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-beta-sdk-dotnet) - Contains the models and request builders for accessing the `beta` endpoint with the fluent API. Microsoft.Graph.Beta has a dependency on Microsoft.Graph.Core.
- [Microsoft.Graph.Core](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-dotnet) - The core library for making calls to Microsoft Graph.

#### Create a Microsoft Graph client

The Microsoft Graph client is designed to make it simple to make calls to Microsoft Graph. You can use a single client instance for the lifetime of the application. The following code examples show how to create an instance of a Microsoft Graph client. The authentication provider handles acquiring access tokens for the application. The different application providers support different client scenarios. For details about which provider and options are appropriate for your scenario, see [Choose an Authentication Provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/sdks/choose-authentication-providers).

```csharp
var scopes = new[] { "User.Read" };

// Multi-tenant apps can use "common",
// single-tenant apps must use the tenant ID from the Azure portal
var tenantId = "common";

// Value from app registration
var clientId = "YOUR_CLIENT_ID";

// using Azure.Identity;
var options = new TokenCredentialOptions
{
    AuthorityHost = AzureAuthorityHosts.AzurePublicCloud
};

// Callback function that receives the user prompt
// Prompt contains the generated device code that you must
// enter during the auth process in the browser
Func<DeviceCodeInfo, CancellationToken, Task> callback = (code, cancellation) => {
    Console.WriteLine(code.Message);
    return Task.FromResult(0);
};

// https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.identity.devicecodecredential
var deviceCodeCredential = new DeviceCodeCredential(
    callback, tenantId, clientId, options);

var graphClient = new GraphServiceClient(deviceCodeCredential, scopes);
```

#### Read information from Microsoft Graph

To read information from Microsoft Graph, you first need to create a request object, and then run the `GET` method on the request.

```csharp
// GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me

var user = await graphClient.Me
    .Request()
    .GetAsync();
```

#### Retrieve a list of entities

Retrieving a list of entities is similar to retrieving a single entity except there are other options for configuring the request. The `$filter` query parameter can be used to reduce the result set to only those rows that match the provided condition. The `$orderBy` query parameter requests that the server provides the list of entities sorted by the specified properties.

```csharp
// GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages?
// $select=subject,sender&$filter=subject eq 'Hello world'
var messages = await graphClient.Me.Messages
    .GetAsync(requestConfig =>
    {
        requestConfig.QueryParameters.Select =
            ["subject", "sender"];
        requestConfig.QueryParameters.Filter =
            "subject eq 'Hello world'";
    });
```

#### Delete an entity

Delete requests are constructed in the same way as requests to retrieve an entity, but use a `DELETE` request instead of a `GET`.

```csharp
// DELETE https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/messages/{message-id}
// messageId is a string containing the id property of the message
await graphClient.Me.Messages[messageId]
    .DeleteAsync();
```

#### Create a new entity

For fluent style and template-based SDKs, new items can be added to collections with a `POST` method.

```csharp
// POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/calendars
var calendar = new Calendar
{
    Name = "Volunteer",
};

var newCalendar = await graphClient.Me.Calendars
    .PostAsync(calendar);
```

### Apply best practices to Microsoft Graph

This unit describes best practices that you can apply to help your applications get the most out of Microsoft Graph and make your application more reliable for end users.

#### Authentication

To access the data in Microsoft Graph, your application needs to acquire an OAuth 2.0 access token, and present it to Microsoft Graph in either of the following methods:

- The HTTP _Authorization_ request header, as a _Bearer_ token
- The graph client constructor, when using a Microsoft Graph client library

Use the Microsoft Authentication Library API, [MSAL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-libraries) to acquire the access token to Microsoft Graph.

#### Consent and authorization

Apply the following best practices for consent and authorization in your app:

- **Use least privilege**. Only request permissions that are necessary, and only when you need them. For the APIs, your application calls check the permissions section in the method topics. For example, see [creating a user](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-post-users) and choose the least privileged permissions.
- **Use the correct permission type based on scenarios**. If you're building an interactive application where a signed in user is present, your application should use delegated permissions. If, however, your application runs without a signed-in user, such as a background service or daemon, your application should use application permissions.

  :stop_sign: Using application permissions for interactive scenarios can put your application at compliance and security risk. Be sure to check user's privileges to ensure they don't have undesired access to information, or are circumnavigating policies configured by an administrator.

- **Consider the end user and admin experience**. This will directly affect end user and admin experiences. For example:

  - Consider who is consenting to your application, either end users or administrators, and configure your application to [request permissions appropriately](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent).
  - Ensure that you understand the difference between [static, dynamic, and incremental consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#consent-types).

- **Consider multi-tenant applications**. Expect customers to have various application and consent controls in different states. For example:

  - Tenant administrators can disable the ability for end users to consent to applications. In this case, an administrator would need to consent on behalf of their users.
  - Tenant administrators can set custom authorization policies such as blocking users from reading other user's profiles, or limiting self-service group creation to a limited set of users. In this case, your application should expect to handle 403 error response when acting on behalf of a user.

#### Handle responses effectively

Depending on the requests you make to Microsoft Graph, your applications should be prepared to handle different types of responses. The following are some of the most important practices to follow to ensure that your application behaves reliably and predictably for your end users. For example:

- **Pagination**: When querying resource collections, you should expect that Microsoft Graph will return the result set in multiple pages, due to server-side page size limits. Your application should always handle the possibility that the responses are paged in nature, and use the `@odata.nextLink` property to obtain the next paged set of results, until all pages of the result set have been read. The final page won't contain an `@odata.nextLink` property. For more information, visit [paging](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/paging).
- **Evolvable enumerations**: Adding members to existing enumerations can break applications already using these enums. Evolvable enums are a mechanism that Microsoft Graph API uses to add new members to existing enumerations without causing a breaking change for applications. By default, a GET operation returns only known members for properties of evolvable enum types and your application needs to handle only the known members. If you design your application to handle unknown members as well, you can opt in to receive those members by using an HTTP `Prefer` request header.

#### Storing data locally

Your application should ideally make calls to Microsoft Graph to retrieve data in real time as necessary. You should only cache or store data locally necessary for a specific scenario. If that use case is covered by your terms of use and privacy policy, and doesn't violate the [Microsoft APIs Terms of Use](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/microsoft-apis/terms-of-use?context=/graph/context), your application should also implement proper retention and deletion policies.
