Question: You are a developer tasked with deploying a new .NET web application using on Microsoft Azure. Your first task is to create a new resource group `myResourceGroup` located in the South Central US region. Following that, you need to establish a deployment user for the web application. You are then required to create `myAppServicePlan` App Service plan within a Linux environment that is cost-efficient. The web application should be created within this resource group and App Service plan, using .NET as its runtime. You are also required to configure the application settings to set the deployment branch to `main`. Lastly, you are provided with a sample application from GitHub: `https://github.com/Azure-Samples/App-Service-Troubleshoot-Azure-Monitor`. You need to clone this application, rename the default branch to `main`, add the Azure remote repository using the URL from the webapp create command, and push the code to the Azure repository. How would you accomplish these tasks using Azure CLI commands?

```ps
# Code here
```

Answer:

```ps
# Create a new resource group in the South Central US region
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location "South Central US"

# Set up a deployment user for the web application
az webapp deployment user set --user-name <username> --password <password>

# Create an App Service plan with a Linux environment. The SKU B1 is chosen for its cost efficiency.
az appservice plan create --name myAppServicePlan --resource-group myResourceGroup --sku B1 --is-linux

# Create the web application within the resource group and the App Service plan, using .NET as its runtime
az webapp create --resource-group myResourceGroup --plan myAppServicePlan --name MyApp --runtime "DOTNET|6.0" --deployment-local-git

# Capture the Git URL from the output of the previous command
git_url=$(az webapp show --name MyApp --resource-group myResourceGroup --query gitUrl --output tsv)

# Configure the application settings to set the deployment branch to 'main'
az webapp config appsettings set --name MyApp --resource-group myResourceGroup --settings DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH='main'

# Clone the sample application from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/App-Service-Troubleshoot-Azure-Monitor

# Navigate into the cloned repository
cd App-Service-Troubleshoot-Azure-Monitor

# Rename the default branch to 'main'
git branch -m main

# Add the Azure remote repository using the URL from the webapp create command
git remote add azure $git_url

# Push the code to the Azure repository
git push azure main
```

Question: You're an Azure developer with the task of deploying a PHP web app from a GitHub repo to Azure App Services. As a part of your workflow, you want to test the new features of your app in a safe, isolated environment before making it live.

Your task is to script the process to deploy the app to an Azure App Service, using a staging deployment slot to validate updates before they go live. This involves creating all necessary resources in Azure, such as a resource group and an App Service plan. After verifying the new version of the app works as expected, swaps the staging slot into production. It should be optimized for cost efficiency.

```ps
let "randomIdentifier=$RANDOM*$RANDOM"
location="East US"
resourceGroup="msdocs-app-service-rg-$randomIdentifier"
tag="deploy-deployment-slot.sh"
appServicePlan="msdocs-app-service-plan-$randomIdentifier"
webapp="msdocs-web-app-$randomIdentifier"
gitrepo=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/php-docs-hello-world

# Code here
```

Answer:

```ps
let "randomIdentifier=$RANDOM*$RANDOM"
location="East US"
resourceGroup="msdocs-app-service-rg-$randomIdentifier"
tag="deploy-deployment-slot.sh"
appServicePlan="msdocs-app-service-plan-$randomIdentifier"
webapp="msdocs-web-app-$randomIdentifier"
gitrepo=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/php-docs-hello-world

# Create a resource group.
az group create --name $resourceGroup --location "$location" --tag $tag

# Create an App Service plan in STANDARD tier (minimum required by deployment slots).
echo "Creating $appServicePlan"
az appservice plan create --name $appServicePlan --resource-group $resourceGroup --location "$location" \
--sku S1

# Create a web app
az webapp create --name $webapp --plan $appServicePlan --resource-group $resourceGroup

# Create a deployment slot with the name "staging".
az webapp deployment slot create --name $webapp --resource-group $resourceGroup --slot staging

# Deploy sample code to "staging" slot from GitHub.
az webapp deployment source config --name $webapp --resource-group $resourceGroup --slot staging --repo-url $gitrepo --branch master --manual-integration

# Swap the verified/warmed up staging slot into production.
az webapp deployment slot swap --name $webapp --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --slot staging
```

Note: If there was no deployment slots requirenments, `az webapp deployment slot create` and `az webapp deployment slot swap` (and `--slot staging` in `az webapp deployment source config`) could be dropped, and app service plan can go as low as FREE.

Question: You're an Azure developer working on a hobby project, deploying a PHP web app from a GitHub repo to Azure App Services. As part of your hands-on learning, you aim to automate the entire deployment process using a script.

Your mission is to script the deployment of the app to an Azure App Service. This process involves spinning up all the necessary resources in Azure, such as a resource group and an App Service plan. The goal is to have your application live and running on the Azure App Service at the end of the script execution, avoiding unnecessary costs.

```ps
let "randomIdentifier=$RANDOM*$RANDOM"
location="East US"
resourceGroup="msdocs-app-service-rg-$randomIdentifier"
tag="deploy-github.sh"
gitrepo=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/php-docs-hello-world
appServicePlan="msdocs-app-service-plan-$randomIdentifier"
webapp="msdocs-web-app-$randomIdentifier"

# Code here
```

Answer:

```ps
let "randomIdentifier=$RANDOM*$RANDOM"
location="East US"
resourceGroup="msdocs-app-service-rg-$randomIdentifier"
tag="deploy-github.sh"
gitrepo=https://github.com/Azure-Samples/php-docs-hello-world
appServicePlan="msdocs-app-service-plan-$randomIdentifier"
webapp="msdocs-web-app-$randomIdentifier"

# Create a resource group.
az group create --name $resourceGroup --location "$location" --tag $tag

# Create an App Service plan in `FREE` tier.
az appservice plan create --name $appServicePlan --resource-group $resourceGroup --sku FREE

# Create a web app.
az webapp create --name $webapp --resource-group $resourceGroup --plan $appServicePlan

# Deploy code from a public GitHub repository.
az webapp deployment source config --name $webapp --resource-group $resourceGroup \
    --repo-url $gitrepo --branch master --manual-integration
```

Note: If there is deployment slots requirenment, then `az webapp deployment slot create` and `az webapp deployment slot swap` (and `--slot staging` in `az webapp deployment source config`) should be added. Also the app service plan should be bumped to STANDARD.

Question: You're responsible for migrating your company's online store application to a Kubernetes environment hosted on Azure (AKS). This application has a set of microservices, each defined in `serviceA.yaml`, `serviceB.yaml`, and `serviceC.yaml` YAML files. You need to ensure the successful deployment and management of these microservices. Also, let's say you are required to monitor the performance and health of your application, for which you decide to integrate Azure Monitor for containers. How would you accomplish this task?

```ps
# Variables
resourceGroup="MyResourceGroup"
AKSClusterName="MyAKSCluster"
location="West Europe"
monitorWorkspace="MyMonitorWorkspace"
```

Answer:

```ps
# Variables
resourceGroup="MyResourceGroup"
AKSClusterName="MyAKSCluster"
location="West Europe"
monitorWorkspace="MyMonitorWorkspace"

# Create a new resource group in the specified location
az group create --name $resourceGroup --location "$location"

# Create a new AKS cluster in the resource group
az aks create --resource-group $resourceGroup --name $AKSClusterName --generate-ssh-keys

# Get the credentials for the AKS cluster
az aks get-credentials --resource-group $resourceGroup --name $AKSClusterName

# Deploy the microservices to the AKS cluster using their respective YAML files
kubectl apply -f serviceA.yaml
kubectl apply -f serviceB.yaml
kubectl apply -f serviceC.yaml

# Create Log Analytics workspace
az monitor log-analytics workspace create --resource-group $resourceGroup --workspace-name $monitorWorkspace --location $location

# Enable Azure Monitor for containers
az aks enable-addons --resource-group $resourceGroup --name $AKSClusterName --addons monitoring --workspace-resource-id $monitorWorkspace

Question: Imagine you are tasked with deploying a web application on Azure App Service. As part of the task, you are also expected to set up Application Insights for monitoring the performance and usage data of the application, located in resource group `$resourceGroup` and app service plan `$appServicePlan` in location `$location`. All of these activities should be performed using the Azure CLI. How would you go about accomplishing this?

```ps
appName="MyWebApp"
appInsightsName="MyAppInsights"
```

Answer:

```ps
appName="MyWebApp"
appInsightsName="MyAppInsights"

# Create a web app
az webapp create --name $appName --resource-group $resourceGroup --plan $appServicePlan

# Create a new Application Insights resource in the resource group
az monitor app-insights component create --app $appInsightsName --location "$location" --resource-group $resourceGroup

# Enable Application Insights for the web app
az webapp config appsettings set --name $appName --resource-group $resourceGroup --settings APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY="$(az monitor app-insights component show --app $appInsightsName --resource-group $resourceGroup --query instrumentationKey --output tsv)"
```

In the last command, we are using the Azure CLI to get the Instrumentation Key of the newly created Application Insights resource. The `--query` parameter allows us to specify the data to extract, and `--output tsv` is used to format the output as Tab-separated values, which gives us a clean output to use in setting the `APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY` setting.

Question: Imagine you are a developer who needs to set up monitoring for a .NET web application named `myApp` deployed on Microsoft Azure. Your task is to leverage Azure Monitor by creating a Log Analytics workspace within an existing resource group named `myResourceGroup`. After creating the workspace, you need to retrieve the resource ID of the web application and the workspace ID of the newly created Log Analytics workspace. With these IDs, you are then tasked with creating diagnostic settings for the web application to enable Azure Monitor to collect console logs and HTTP logs. How would you perform these tasks using Azure CLI commands?

```ps
# Code here
```

Answer:

```ps
# Create a Log Analytics workspace within the existing resource group named 'myResourceGroup'
az monitor log-analytics workspace create --resource-group myResourceGroup --workspace-name myMonitorWorkspace

# Retrieve the resource ID of the web application named 'myApp'
resourceID=$(az webapp show -g myResourceGroup -n myApp --query id --output tsv)

# Retrieve the workspace ID of the newly created Log Analytics workspace
workspaceID=$(az monitor log-analytics workspace show -g myResourceGroup --workspace-name myMonitorWorkspace --query id --output tsv)

# Create diagnostic settings for the web application to enable Azure Monitor to collect console logs and HTTP logs
az monitor diagnostic-settings create --resource $resourceID \
 --workspace $workspaceID \
 -n myMonitorLogs \
 --logs '[{"category": "AppServiceConsoleLogs", "enabled": true},
  {"category": "AppServiceHTTPLogs", "enabled": true}]'

Question: You are managing an Azure Subscription named `SubscriptionA`, where an Azure App Service named `myAppService` is deployed and running on a Linux environment. The monitoring team requires access to query logs generated by `myAppService`. How should you configure the system to meet this requirement?

- [ ] Enable `AppServiceAppLogs` under Diagnostics settings and set the destination to send logs to the App Service file system.
- [ ] Enable `AppServiceAppLogs` under Diagnostics settings and set the destination to send logs to a Blob Storage Account.
- [x] Enable `AppServiceAppLogs` under Diagnostics settings and set the destination to send logs to Log Analytics.
- [ ] Enable `AppServiceConsoleLogs` under Diagnostics settings and set the destination to send logs to Log Analytics.
- [ ] Enable `AppServiceConsoleLogs` under Diagnostics settings and set the destination to send logs to a Blob Storage Account.
- [ ] Enable `AppServiceConsoleLogs` under Diagnostics settings and set the destination to send logs to Log Analytics.
- [ ] Enable `AllMetrics` under Diagnostics settings and set the destination to send logs to Log Analytics.
- [ ] Enable `AllMetrics` under Diagnostics settings and set the destination to send logs to a Blob Storage Account.
- [ ] Enable `AllMetrics` under Diagnostics settings and set the destination to send logs to Log Analytics.

Answer: Enable `AppServiceAppLogs` sent to `Log Analytics`.

The `Azure Log Analytics` service provides a platform for comprehensive log management and analytics. By enabling `AppServiceAppLogs` under `Diagnostics` settings and setting the destination to send logs to `Log Analytics`, you allow the monitoring team to query and analyze these logs. The other `AppServiceAppLogs` options, while valid Azure services, do not provide the same level of log querying and analysis capabilities as `Log Analytics`.  
`AppServiceConsoleLogs` is incorrect because it is not the appropriate setting for this requirement.  
`AllMetrics` settings are collected by agents on to the App Service and report the usage of host resources. These are items like CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O used.

Question: Which of these statements best describes autoscaling?

- [ ] Autoscaling requires an administrator to actively monitor the workload on a system.
- [x] Autoscaling is a scale out/scale in solution.
- [ ] Scaling up/scale down provides better availability than autoscaling.

Answer: The system can scale out when specified resource metrics indicate increasing usage, and scale in when these metrics drop.

---

Question: Which of these scenarios is a suitable candidate for autoscaling?

- [x] The number of users requiring access to an application varies according to a regular schedule. For example, more users use the system on a Friday than other days of the week.
- [ ] The system is subject to a sudden influx of requests that grinds your system to a halt.
- [ ] Your organization is running a promotion and expects to see increased traffic to their web site for the next couple of weeks.

Answer: Changes in application load that are predictable are good candidates for autoscaling.  
Organization running a promotion: Manual scaling is a better option here since this is a one-off event with a known duration.  
Sudden influx of requests: The increasing burst of activity could be caused by a Denial of Service attack that is attempting to overwhelm your system. Autoscaling wouldn't solve the problem.

Question: Your company has developed a web application that experiences intermittent high traffic volumes. However, the company has noticed that during the sudden traffic spikes, the performance of their application temporarily degrades before it starts to stabilize. The degradation is especially apparent when the application hasn't received any significant traffic for a while. How can you mitigate this performance degradation issue?

- [ ] Manually adjust the number of instances when traffic increases.
- [ ] Set up custom scaling rules based on traffic using Azure Autoscale.
- [x] Implement Azure Automatic Scaling with prewarming of instances.
- [ ] Monitor performance using Azure Application Insights Live Metrics.

Bonus question: You are running on a `Standard` plan, do you need to chenge it in order to implement your solution?

Answer: The problem your company experiences is called _cold boot_. In order to mitigate it, you need Automatic Scaling with pre-warmed/always ready instances. This requires at least `PremiumV2` plan.  
Azure Manual Scaling lacks real-time adjustment capabilities, making it inefficient for sudden traffic spikes.  
Although Azure Autoscale scales based on traffic, it can still experience "cold starts" during sudden traffic spikes.  
Azure Application Insights Live Metrics: This is a monitoring tool, not a scaling solution.
