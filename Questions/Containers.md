# Containers

Question: Which of the following methods is recommended when deploying a multi-container group that includes only containers?

- [ ] Azure Resource Management template
- [x] YAML file
- [ ] `az container create` command

Answer: Due to the YAML format's more concise nature, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes only container instances.  
`az container creates` isn't specific to this scenario.

Question: What is the purpose of a restart policy in Azure Container Instances?

- [ ] To charge customers more for compute resources used while the container is running.
- [ ] To ensure that containers are never restarted, even if the process fails.
- [x] To specify when and how containers should be restarted, based on the desired behavior.

Answer: The restart policy allows you to specify when and how containers should be restarted, based on the desired behavior. This can help optimize resource usage and ensure that tasks are completed successfully.

Question: If you want to mount multiple volumes, what options are at your disposal for deployment?

- [ ] YAML file only
- [x] Azure Resource Manager template and YAML file
- [ ] Azure Resource Manager template and PowerShell

Answer: To mount multiple volumes in a container instance, you must deploy using an Azure Resource Manager template or a YAML file.  
PowerShell alone doesn't directly support volume mounting.

Question: Which of the following methods is recommended when deploying a multi-container group that includes containers and additional Azure service resources (for example, an Azure Files share)?

- [x] Azure Resource Management template
- [ ] YAML file
- [ ] `az container create` command

Answer: Due to the YAML format's more concise nature, a YAML file is recommended when your deployment includes only container instances.  
`az container create` isn't specific to this scenario.

You are deploying a lightweight multi-container workload to Azure Container Instances (ACI). The containers must:

- Start and stop together,
- Communicate over an isolated local network,
- Access the same persistent storage mount, and
- Share allocated compute and memory resources.

Which ACI feature should you use to meet all these requirements?

- [ ] Deployment manifest (YAML)
- [x] Container group
- [ ] Virtual network integration
- [ ] Runtime environment variables

Answer: Container Groups share a lifecycle, resources, local network, and storage volumes.

Question: Which of the following options is true about the built-in authentication feature in Azure Container Apps?

- [ ] It can only be configured to restrict access to authenticated users.
- [x] It allows for out-of-the-box authentication with federated identity providers.
- [ ] It requires the use of a specific SDK.

Answer: Azure Container Apps provides built-in authentication and authorization features to secure your external ingress-enabled container app with minimal or no code.  
The built-in authentication feature can be configured to handle authenticated and non-authenticated users.

---

Question: What is a revision in Azure Container Apps?

- [ ] A dynamic snapshot of a container app version.
- [ ] A version of a container app that is actively being used.
- [x] An immutable snapshot of a container app version.

Answer: A revision is an immutable snapshot of a container app version.  
The security container running the authentication and authorization module doesn't run in-process, so no direct integration with a specific language is possible.

Question: You are tasked with deploying a legacy application written in .NET Framework on Azure. This application's container image is stored in an Azure Container Registry with the address `myAcrRegistry.azurecr.io/myNetApp:latest`.

You need to ensure that the application is properly isolated and manageable within Azure's infrastructure. To do this, write the necessary PowerShell commands to host this application in a container group named `"myContainerGroup"` using Azure Container Instances (ACI).

```ps
# Code here
```

Answer: Because the application needs to be isolated, you need to create a new resource group.

Because .Net Framework is specific to Windows only, you'll need `-OsType "Windows"`

```ps
# Create a new resource group "myResourceGroup"
New-AzResourceGroup -Name "myResourceGroup" -Location "West US"

# Create a new container group "myContainerGroup"
New-AzContainerGroup -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myContainerGroup" -Image "myAcrRegistry.azurecr.io/myNetApp:latest" -OsType "Windows"
```

---

Question: You are planning to deploy a legacy application built using .NET Framework as a containerized solution on Azure. Which operating system type should be specified when creating the Azure Container Group for this application?

- [ ] Linux only
- [x] Windows only
- [ ] Linux or Windows

Answer: The .NET Framework is Windows-specific, so when creating a container for a .NET Framework application, -OsType "Windows" must be used.

---

Question: You are planning to containerize a .NET Core application for deployment on Azure. When creating the Azure Container Group to host this application, which operating system types are viable options?

- [ ] Linux only
- [ ] Windows only
- [x] Linux or Windows

Answer: As .NET Core is a cross-platform framework, it is capable of running on multiple operating systems, including both Linux and Windows. Therefore, both of these options could be potentially specified when creating the Azure Container Group.

---

Question: You are tasked with deploying a .NET Core application on Azure, and you plan to use Azure Container Instances for this purpose. Which PowerShell command should you use to create the necessary resources for hosting this application?

- [ ] `New-AzContainerService`
- [x] `New-AzContainerGroup`
- [ ] First `New-AzContainerGroup`, then `New-AzContainerService`
- [ ] Either `New-AzContainerGroup` or `New-AzContainerService`
- [ ] None of the mentioned

Answer: Azure Container Instances (ACI) are created and managed using the `New-AzContainerGroup` cmdlet. The `New-AzContainerService` cmdlet is used for creating an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), which is a different service from ACI.

---

Question: Which command is used for creating a container image?

- [ ] `az acr create`
- [x] `az acr build`
- [ ] `az acr build` then `az acr create`

Answer: `az acr build` is used to create container image  
`az acr create` is used to create Azure Container registry

---

Question: You are working with a resource group, `MultiContainerGroup1`, which contains several services such as Azure Functions, a CosmosDB instance, and multiple container instances. You need to export this resource group for future deployment. Write the Azure CLI command to export the template for this resource group.

```ps
# Code here
```

Answer: You should use a Resource Manager (ARM) template because this format allows the inclusion of multiple Azure services along with the container instances.

```ps
az group export --name MultiContainerGroup1 --output-template-file "./MultiContainerGroup1.json"
az deployment group create --resource-group MultiContainerGroup1 --template-file "./MultiContainerGroup1.json"
```

---

Question: You have just deployed several Azure resources within the `DemoResourceGroup` resource group and you want to capture the template that Azure Resource Manager used for the deployment for future use. How can you accomplish this efficiently?

- [ ] `az group export --name DemoResourceGroup`
- [x] `az group deployment export --name DemoResourceGroup --deployment-name Deployment1`
- [ ] Use the Azure portal to manually inspect and copy the JSON of the deployment template.
- [ ] `Export-AzResourceGroup -Name DemoResourceGroup`

Answer: The `az group deployment export` command is used to export the template that was used for a specific deployment. This command allows you to capture the exact template used by Azure Resource Manager for that particular deployment.  
Using the Azure portal to manually copy the JSON of the deployment template also is valid way to do it, but is a manual process and inefficient.  
`az group export --name DemoResourceGroup` and `Export-AzResourceGroup -Name DemoResourceGroup` export the resource group (which may include many deployments)  
is a manual process that doesn't provide the convenience or automation of a CLI command

---

Question: What is needed to enable authentication on your Azure Container App?

- [x] A configured ingress rule with `allowInsecure` set to disabled
- [x] Any Identity provider
- [x] A specified Authentication / Authorization provider within the app settings
- [ ] A secret key to be embedded in the app's code
- [ ] A Premium Azure service tier subscription
- [ ] An Azure Container App certificate issued by Microsoft
- [ ] Microsoft Entra ID is required as an Identity provider

Answer: Auth works only with HTTPS, requires any identity provider and specified provider within app settings. Authough Entra ID is a valid option, it's incorrect to state it's required.

Question: You want to store and manage private Docker images that your application will use. Which Azure CLI command would be most appropriate to achieve this?

- [ ] `az containerapp create`
- [x] `az acr create`
- [ ] `az container create`
- [ ] `az containerapp up`

Answer: `az acr create` - The Azure Container Registry (ACR) service stores and manages private Docker container images. Using the `az acr create` command creates a new ACR, allowing you to handle and manage your Docker images.

---

Question: You have a single-container application that doesn't require advanced orchestration features like scaling or networking with other containers. Which Azure CLI command would be the most suitable for this purpose?

- [ ] `az acr create`
- [x] `az container create`
- [ ] `az containerapp create`
- [ ] `az acr build`
- [ ] `az containerapp up`

Answer: `az container create` - Azure Container Instances (ACI) is a service that allows you to run containers directly without the need for any orchestration service. The `az container create` command is used to create these instances, which are ideal for single, isolated workloads.

---

Question: Your team has developed a new microservices-based application, and you need to deploy these services on Azure. Which command allows you to deploy these applications with scaling and orchestration features?

- [ ] `az container create`
- [ ] `az acr create`
- [ ] `az acr build`
- [x] `az containerapp create`

Answer: `az containerapp create` - Azure Container Apps is a serverless container service that provides advanced features such as scaling and orchestration. The `az containerapp create` command is used to create a new Azure Container App, which is ideal for deploying microservices.

---

Question: In the context of Dapr, what is the purpose of a Dapr sidecar and how does it interact with a container app?

- [ ] The Dapr sidecar is used to manage the lifecycle of the container app and has no direct interaction with the app itself.
- [x] The Dapr sidecar is used to expose Dapr APIs to the container app, which can be invoked via HTTP or gRPC.
- [ ] The Dapr sidecar is used to provide a user interface for managing the container app and can be accessed via a web browser.
- [ ] The Dapr sidecar is used to store the state of the container app and periodically syncs this state with the app.

Answer: A Dapr sidecar exposes Dapr's APIs to your application, enabling features like service invocation and state management over HTTP or gRPC.  
While Dapr does provide state management capabilities, it's not the sidecar's responsibility to store the state of the container app and periodically sync it.

---

Question: What is the default behavior of Dapr-enabled container apps regarding the loading of Dapr components?

- [ ] They load no components by default.
- [ ] They load only the components specified in the application's configuration.
- [x] They load the full set of deployed components.
- [ ] They load components based on the runtime context.

Answer: They load the full set of deployed components.

---

Question: What is the primary function of the "Observability" feature in Dapr?

- [ ] It provides a user interface for monitoring the state of your application.
- [x] It sends tracing information to an Application Insights backend.
- [ ] It allows you to observe the behavior of other services in your application.
- [ ] It provides a dashboard for visualizing the performance of your application.

Answer: It sends tracing information to an Application Insights backend.

---

Question: What is the recommended solution if you need a stable public IP address for your container group, especially considering potential container group restarts?

- [ ] Use a hardcoded IP address in your container group configuration.
- [ ] Configure a different subnet for your container group.
- [ ] Utilize Azure Load Balancer to manage IP address changes.
- [x] Use Application Gateway to ensure a static public IP address.

Answer: To address the potential IP changes when a container group restarts, it's advisable to use Application Gateway. Application Gateway provides a stable public IP address that remains consistent even if the container group's IP changes due to restarts or other factors.

---

Question: If a container group restarts, what will happen to its IP address?

- [ ] The IP address will always remain the same.
- [ ] The IP address will change to a different subnet.
- [x] The IP address might change.
- [ ] The IP address will change only if a new image is deployed.

Answer: When a container group restarts, there's a possibility that its IP address might change. This uncertainty is due to the dynamic nature of container group deployments. It's important not to rely on hardcoded IP addresses in such scenarios.

---

Question: What happens when you update an application secret in Azure Container App?

- [ ] A new revision is created
- [ ] The application restarts to reflect the updated value
- [x] Nothing happens

Answer: Adding, removing, or changing secrets doesn't generate new revisions. Apps need to be restarted to reflect updates.

---

Question: You have deployed a container using the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: 2018-10-01
location: eastus
name: securetest
properties:
  containers:
    - name: mycontainer
      properties:
        environmentVariables:
          - name: 'EXPOSED'
            value: 'my-exposed-value'
          - name: 'SECRET'
            secureValue: 'my-secret-value'
  osType: Linux
  restartPolicy: Always
tags: null
type: Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
```

You want to retrieve the value of the environment variable "SECRET" using the Azure CLI and execute the following command:

```bash
az container show --resource-group myResourceGroup --name securetest --query "properties.containers[0].properties.environmentVariables[?name=='SECRET']"
```

What should you expect from this command?

- [ ] The value "my-secret-value" will be displayed.
- [ ] An error will be thrown since the secret value cannot be accessed.
- [x] Only the variable's name "SECRET" will be displayed, not its value.
- [ ] The entire container's properties will be displayed.

Answer: The given YAML configuration demonstrates how to set a secure environment variable named "SECRET" with the `secureValue` property. When viewing container properties through the Azure portal or Azure CLI, only the secure variable's name is displayed, not its value. Therefore, executing the given command will show the name of the secure variable "SECRET", but not its actual value.

---

Question: You have deployed a container using the following YAML configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: 2018-10-01
location: eastus
name: securetest
properties:
  containers:
    - name: mycontainer
    properties:
      image: mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/hello-world
      ports:
      - port: 80
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 1.0
          memoryInGB: 1.5
  osType: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
  restartPolicy: Always
tags: null
type: Microsoft.ContainerInstance/containerGroups
```

What should you use for `osType`?

- [ ] AMD64
- [ ] Linux
- [ ] Windows
- [x] Both Linux and Windows will work
- [ ] Neither option will work

Answer: Since this is a single container instance, both Windows and Linux would work. Two or more is for multi-containers, thus Linux only.

---

Question: You have declared a connection string to a queue storage account in the `--secrets` parameter of a container app. Now you need to reference this secret in an environment variable when creating a new revision in your container app.

Which of the following commands correctly references the secret `queue-connection-string` in an environment variable in the Azure CLI?

- [x] `--env-vars "ConnectionString=secretref:queue-connection-string"`
- [ ] `--env-vars "ConnectionString=queue-connection-string"`
- [ ] `--env-vars "ConnectionString=$CONNECTION_STRING"`
- [ ] `--env-vars "ConnectionString=$queue-connection-string"`

Answer: The correct way to reference a secret in an environment variable in the Azure CLI is to set its value to `secretref:`, followed by the name of the secret.

Question: You are using Azure Container Registry with the Standard service tier to manage images for a rapidly growing project. Recently, your team has noticed inconsistencies in overall performance during deployment workflows. Some members have reported delays when accessing certain images, while others claim operations occasionally fail under high load.

Which of the following actions could most effectively address the performance issues without incurring additional costs?

- [ ] Upgrade to a more powerful local machine.
- [ ] Upgrade to the Premium plan.
- [x] Delete unused repositories and tags.
- [ ] Increase the bandwidth of your internet connection.
- [ ] Call Azure support.

Answer: Performance degradation is likely due to the overhead of managing excessive metadata (unused repositories and tags) in the registry. Cleaning up these resources reduces lookup times and improves efficiency without incurring additional costs.

While upgrading to Premium would resolve performance issues by increasing throughput and capacity, the scenario specifies budget constraints, making this option impractical.

---

Question: Which container registry tier has the highest throughput?

- [ ] Basic
- [ ] Standard
- [x] Premium

Answer: Premium has the highest throughput.

Question: Given a Dockerfile in your current directory with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/hello-world
```

You are asked to run an image in Azure from a Container Registry named `myContainerRegistry008`. The image should be tagged as `sample/hello-world:v1`.

Assume that the Azure subscription and Azure CLI have already been configured on your local system. However, the necessary resources for running the image, such as the resource group and container registry, have not yet been created.

Considering all these requirements, write down the sequence of Azure CLI commands necessary to successfully run the image from the specified container registry.

Answer:

```Dockerfile
# Create a resource group named 'myResourceGroup' in 'eastus' location
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Create an Azure container registry named 'myContainerRegistry008' within the 'myResourceGroup'
az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myContainerRegistry008 --sku Basic

# Authenticate Docker client to the registry
az acr login --name myContainerRegistry008

# Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile in the current directory, tag it as 'sample/hello-world:v1',
# and push it to the 'myContainerRegistry008' registry
az acr build --registry myContainerRegistry008 --image sample/hello-world:v1 .

# Execute the image from the registry
az acr run --registry myContainerRegistry008 --cmd '$Registry/sample/hello-world:v1' /dev/null
```

Question: You are managing an Azure Container Registry named `myregistry`. You have a task to publish the most recent `windows/servercore` container image from the Microsoft Container Registry into your registry. After importing, you want the image to be tagged as `servercore:ltsc2019` in your registry. Write the Azure CLI command that would be needed to accomplish this.

```ps
# Code here
```

Answer:

```ps
az acr import \
--name myregistry \ # specifies the name of your Azure Container Registry
--source mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:latest \ # the fully qualified source image reference
--image servercore:ltsc2019 # the new tag you want the image to have in your registry
```

Question: You are working with an Azure Container Registry and you exceed the request limits for your service tier. What is the expected behavior when this happens, and what strategies should you implement to mitigate the impact on container operations?

- [ ] The registry will throttle all pull and push operations, resulting in an `HTTP 429 error`, and you will need to upgrade your service tier to continue operations.
- [ ] The registry will begin returning `HTTP 503 errors`, and you must reconfigure your container deployment pipeline to reduce the frequency of image pulls and pushes.
- [x] The registry will temporarily throttle pull and push operations, returning an `HTTP 429 error`, and you should implement retry logic with exponential backoff to mitigate the issue.
- [ ] The registry will continue to operate normally, but container operations will slow down as a result of throttling, requiring no further intervention.

Answer: When you exceed the request limits in Azure Container Registry, [throttling](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-skus#throttling) occurs, resulting in an `HTTP 429 error`. The recommended solution is implementing retry logic with exponential backoff to handle the temporary throttling and resume operations smoothly.

Upgrading the tier isn’t necessary to resolve throttling.

Question: If you're developing a Linux-based ASP.NET Core application that is planned to be deployed via Azure Container Instances, and you need to launch it in a geographic region where your company doesn't have an existing resource group, what sequence of Azure CLI commands would you utilize to correctly deploy your application in that target region?

```ps
location="West Europe"
resourceGroup="WEurope"
containerGroup="WEuropeGroup"
containerName="AspContainer"
containerImage="mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld"

# Code here
```

Answer:

```ps
location="West Europe"
resourceGroup="WEurope"
containerGroup="WEuropeGroup"
containerName="AspContainer"
containerImage="mcr.microsoft.com/azuredocs/aci-helloworld"

# Create a new resource group in the West Europe region
az group create --name $resourceGroup --location "$location"

# Create a container group (ACI) in the new resource group
az container create --name $containerName --resource-group $resourceGroup --image $containerImage --dns-name-label $containerGroup --location $location
```

Question: You have an ASP.NET Core application running within an Azure Container Instance (ACI) and your monitoring team has a unique container image loaded with their monitoring tools. To ensure compliance, you have been tasked with attaching a "sidecar" container (an auxiliary container that works alongside the main application container) from the same host. However, you must take into account that the solution should be cost-effective and require minimal changes to the current application, keeping the setup simple. What Azure service would you employ to realize this objective?

- [x] ACI Container Groups
- [ ] Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- [ ] Azure App Services
- [ ] Azure Container Registry
- [ ] Azure Service Fabric

Answer: The most suitable service to accomplish this is Azure Container Instances (ACI) Container Groups. This service allows you to run multiple containers, maintained by different teams, deployed together as a group on the same host. Each deployed container instance will share the resources of the host and are able to communicate which each other (in this case: your application and the monitoring sidecar). This offers an economical solution without the need for significant changes to your existing application, and it aligns with the sidecar container model.  
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) allows running multiple containers on the same host, which supports the sidecar pattern. However, it introduces additional complexity and potential cost increases due to the need for managing clusters and implementing scaling features.  
Azure App Services provides a platform for hosting web applications and RESTful APIs, including those in containers. The downside is that it does not natively support the sidecar pattern and can lead to higher costs as the scale of operations increases.  
Azure Container Registry serves as a storage and management solution for container images. It is primarily a storage service and does not provide the functionalities to deploy containers or implement the sidecar pattern.  
Azure Service Fabric is a platform that provides orchestration of microservices and containers, and could technically support the sidecar pattern. However, it requires a deeper understanding of the microservices architecture and might not be the most cost-effective or simple solution for running a single application with a monitoring sidecar.

Question: As a developer in a startup, you're helping your team transition to Microsoft Azure. Your task is to deploy a containerized API service, `MyAPI`, on Azure from an older Linux workstation. The source code for `MyAPI` is stored locally in the `./src` directory and is also tracked on the GitHub repository `myuser/myrepo`.

Before deploying, you'll need to create a production environment named `prod`. The Azure CLI on your workstation should be up-to-date, but given its age and the type of service you're deploying, you're unsure if all necessary tools and extensions are available.

`MyAPI` utilizes services that allow for hosting of RESTful APIs and collection and analysis of telemetry data. So, ensure to configure your Azure account accordingly before deployment. Once your local setup is prepared, deploy `MyAPI` to a resource group named `MyResourceGroup` in the `eastus` region using the `prod` environment.

Can you draft an Azure CLI script to achieve these tasks?

```ps
# Code here
```

Answer:

```ps
# Check the current Azure CLI version on the old Linux workstation, and upgrade if needed
az upgrade

# The nature of the application (a containerized service) hints at the need for the containerapp extension. So, add and upgrade it.
az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade

# It's time to connect to Azure once all the local tasks are completed.
# However, you could technically log in at any time before this.
az login

# Register the necessary providers as the application uses services for hosting APIs and telemetry analysis
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.OperationalInsights

# Create the 'prod' environment
az containerapp env create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name prod

# Deploy the API service
az containerapp up \
  --name MyAPI \
  --resource-group MyResourceGroup \
  --location eastus \
  --environment prod \
  --context-path ./src \
  --repo myuser/myrepo
```

In the context of deploying containerized applications on Azure, the command `az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade` is essential to interact with Azure Container Apps service. The `--upgrade` flag is used to ensure that you have the latest version of the extension. This is especially critical when your workstation is older, and there's uncertainty regarding the presence and version of the necessary tools and extensions.

The `az login` command logs you into your Azure account. Although we performed all the local tasks like upgrading the Azure CLI and adding the necessary extension before logging into Azure, technically you could log into Azure at any time. The reason why we log in after performing local tasks is just to make sure that we've done everything we can do locally before initiating a connection to Azure. This could help avoid unnecessary delays or connection timeouts, especially if you're on a slow or unreliable network.

- `Microsoft.App`: This namespace is typically used when your application leverages Azure App Services. Azure App Services provide a platform to host web apps, mobile app back ends, RESTful APIs, or automated business processes. If your application doesn't use any of the services provided by Azure App Service, you may not need to register this provider.

- `Microsoft.OperationalInsights`: This namespace is associated with Azure Log Analytics. If your application uses Azure Monitor Log Analytics to collect and analyze telemetry and other data, you need to register this provider. Log Analytics can provide insights about your applications, infrastructure, and network. If you don't use these services, you might not need this provider.

  Note: Explicit provider registration is not typically necessary for Azure services. It's often handled automatically when you create a resource that belongs to a provider, although there can be exceptions.

The command `az containerapp env create` is used to create an environment in Azure Container Apps. This command creates an environment under a specific resource group with a given name. An environment is a space where you can deploy container apps. You can have different environments for different stages of your app like development, staging, and production. Each environment can have its own configuration like compute resources, networking settings, etc. For your use case, we've assumed that the prod environment has been already configured as per your production specifications.

Question: As a DevOps engineer at ABC Industries, you are in charge of deploying a Node.js web service that communicates with a MongoDB database to Microsoft Azure. This service relies on environment variables `DB_URL` and `SECRET_TOKEN` for database connection and secure interactions, respectively. The service's Docker image is hosted on Docker Hub under `abcindustries/ai-service-app`.

For deployment, an Azure Container App should be created under the name `ai-service-app`, located in the `westus2` region within the `abc-industries` resource group. The app will run on port 8000 and needs DB_URL and SECRET_TOKEN set to `mongodb://username:password@dbhost:27017/dbname` and `sometoken` respectively. The container instance should have suitable CPU and memory specifications.

Considering these requirements, how would you employ Azure CLI to set up this Azure Container App?

```ps
# Code here
```

Answer:

```ps
# Log into the Azure account
az login

# Upgrade the Azure CLI to the latest version
az upgrade

# Add and upgrade the containerapp extension
az extension add --name containerapp --upgrade

# Register the necessary providers as the microservice uses services for hosting APIs
az provider register --namespace Microsoft.App

# Create the 'dev' environment
az containerapp env create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name dev

# Create the container application
az containerapp create \
  --name ai-service-app \
  --resource-group abc-industries \
  --environment-variables DB_URL=mongodb://username:password@dbhost:27017/dbname SECRET_TOKEN=sometoken \
  --docker-image abcindustries/ai-service-app \
  --region westus2 \
  --target-port 8000 \
  --cpu <CPU_CORES> \
  --memory <MEMORY_GB>
```

`az containerapp create` gives you more control over the configuration and is suitable for setting up a new application or when making changes to an existing application in a production environment.

Question: You are designing a microservices-based application using Azure Container Apps. The architecture will include eight separate container apps. You are evaluating whether to deploy them in a single Container Apps environment or across multiple environments.

Which two requirements would justify deploying multiple environments?

- [ ] Each app must authenticate against a different Azure Active Directory tenant.
- [ ] Each app must scale based on different CPU and memory usage thresholds.
- [x] Each app must be isolated to a different virtual network.
- [x] Each app must send logs to a separate Log Analytics workspace for auditing purposes.
- [ ] Each app uses a different container registry for pulling images.

Answer:

- VNet isolation is bound to the Container Apps Environment. If you need multiple VNets, you need multiple environments.
- Log Analytics workspace is set at the environment level. Different destinations require separate environments.
- AAD auth is configurable per app via identity provider config; environments don’t constrain this.
- ACA supports individual autoscaling configs per app (via KEDA rules), even in the same environment.
- Container registry configuration is at the app level (you can pull from different registries within one environment).

Question: How can you maintain the availability of a crucial website hosted on Azure Container Apps, even if a single Azure datacenter goes down, while keeping the solution simple and using the least number of Azure services?

- [x] Activate zone redundancy in the Container Apps setting.
- [ ] Set up automatic Azure DevOps deployment pipelines to shift to a new region if the primary datacenter fails.
- [ ] Use multiple regions and route requests via Azure Front Door.

Answer: The optimal solution is to activate zone redundancy in the Container Apps setting. This distributes Azure Container Apps replicas across multiple availability zones, ensuring the website stays operational even if a datacenter fails. Using multiple regions and Azure Front Door or setting up automatic Azure DevOps deployment pipelines would either involve additional services or cause temporary downtime, making them less ideal.

Question: You are working on a project that requires deploying a containerized application in Azure. The application has two key requirements: It needs to run a process that requires root access, and it must be hosted on a Windows-based operating system. You are considering Azure Container Apps as a hosting option. Which of the following statements is correct regarding the feasibility of using Azure Container Apps for this project?

- [ ] Azure Container Apps can fulfill both requirements.
- [ ] Azure Container Apps can only fulfill the requirement of running a process that requires root access but not the Windows-based operating system requirement.
- [ ] Azure Container Apps can only fulfill the Windows-based operating system requirement but not the requirement of running a process that requires root access.
- [x] Azure Container Apps cannot fulfill either of the requirements for this project.

Answer: Azure Container Apps can't run privileged containers, and if a process requires root access, it will cause a runtime error. This rules out fulfilling the first requirement. It also only support Linux-based (linux/amd64) container images, which rules out hosting on a Windows-based operating system.

		{
			"properties": {
				"template": {
					"scale": {
						"minReplicas": 1,
						"maxReplicas": 3
					}
				}
			}
		}
	]
}
```

- [ ] All existing revisions will have max 5 replicas now.
- [ ] A new revision is created. All revisions now have 5 max replicas now.
- [x] A new revision is created with 5 max replicas. All existing revisions remain unchanged.

Answer: Changes made to the `template` section are revision-scope changes, which triggers a new revision. The changes are limited to the revision in which they're deployed, and don't affect other revisions.

Question: What command should you execute to verify if your image has been successfully pushed to Azure Container Registry?

- [x] `az acr repository list`
- [ ] `docker images`
- [ ] `az acr show`
- [ ] `az acr login`
- [ ] `az acr task list`

Answer: `az acr repository list` lists the repositories in the specified Azure Container Registry, allowing you to verify if your image is present.  
`docker images` lists the images available on your local machine, not in the Azure Container Registry.  
`az acr show` retrieves detailed information about the specified container registry, but does not list the images or repositories.  
`az acr task list` lists all the tasks for a specified container registry, which are used for automated container image building.

- [x] Webhooks
- [ ] Azure Event Hub
- [ ] Azure Event Grid

Answer: Webhooks in Azure Container Registry allow you to trigger actions in response to events like image pushes or pulls, making it suitable for automating updates.

---

Question: You are deploying a containerized application in Azure.

Requirements:

- The application uses SQL Server in a container, and the database files must be stored on a persistent volume that supports the SMB protocol.
- The application must automatically redeploy whenever a new container image is pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR).

What should you configure?

- [x] ACR Webhooks
- [ ] Azure Event Hub
- [ ] Azure Event Grid
- [ ] Azure Blob storage
- [ ] Azure Queue storage
- [ ] Azure Table storage
- [x] Azure Files
- [ ] Azure DevOps Pipeline

Answer:

- **ACR Webhooks**: Automatically notify your deployment system (e.g., AKS, App Service, Function) when a new image is pushed, enabling continuous deployment.
- **Azure Files**: Provides persistent shared storage over SMB, suitable for SQL Server instances running inside containers.
- **Azure Event Hub/Event Grid**: General eventing/messaging platforms; not the direct mechanism ACR uses for image updates.
- **Azure Blob/Table/Queue**: Storage services for blobs, NoSQL data, or queues. None provide SMB support or automatic image update triggers.
- **Azure DevOps Pipeline**: Useful for orchestrating deployments but does not inherently trigger on ACR image pushes without webhooks.
