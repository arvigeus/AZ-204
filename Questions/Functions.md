Question: What is a key benefit of the Flex Consumption plan in Azure Functions hosting options?

- [ ] It provides fully predictable billing and manual scale instances.
- [x] It offers high scalability with compute choices, virtual networking, and pay-as-you-go billing.
- [ ] It allows for the packaging of custom libraries with function code.

Answer: The Flex Consumption plan provides high scalability, compute choices, virtual networking, and pay-as-you-go billing.  
Fully predictable billing and manual scale instances is a feature of the Dedicated plan.  
Packaging of custom libraries with function code is a feature of Container Apps, not the Flex Consumption plan.

Question: You need your Azure Function to use different connection strings when working locally, and when working on production. How to achieve that?

- [ ] Store connection strings in `function.json`
- [ ] Store connection strings in Key Vault and read them in your function
- [ ] Create two versions of the function, one for production and one for local development
- [ ] Store connection string into `host.json` file
- [x] Store connection string into `local.settings.json` file

Answer: When running locally, Azure Functions read configuration values from `local.settings.json`, which emulates the cloud-based `Application Settings`. In Azure, the function reads directly from `Application Settings` configured in the Function App. This separation allows you to manage environment-specific settings without modifying the codebase.

---

Question: You’re deploying an Azure Function written in C# script. It needs to connect to an Azure SQL database in production. Where should the connection string be stored for the deployed app?

- [ ] `host.json`
- [ ] `function.json`
- [ ] `local.settings.json`
- [x] `Application Settings` in Azure Portal

Answer: In production, secrets like connection strings must be stored securely, and Application Settings (under Configuration in the Azure Function's app settings) is the correct place. Azure automatically makes these values available as environment variables.

- `host.json`: Defines global runtime settings (e.g., logging, timeouts). Not for secrets like connection strings.
- `function.json`: only references configuration values from `Application Settings`; it does not define or store secrets.
- `local.settings.json`: Can be used for connection string, but it's used for local development only. Ignored in deployment; never reaches Azure.

---

Question: You are tasked with altering the `host.json` file to adjust runtime settings for a function app, aiming to keep the process as straightforward as possible. What method would you utilize?

- [x] Azure Portal
- [ ] Visual Studio Code or other text editor
- [ ] Azure Powershell cmdlets
- [ ] Azure CLI commands
- [ ] Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template

Answer: Azure Portal allows for direct and simple changes to the host.json file in the Function App settings, reducing effort needed.  
Visual Studio Code could be used to edit the host.json file, but this requires downloading the project locally, making changes, and then re-deploying it, which increases effort.  
Azure CLI and Azure Powershell does not include the necessary commands to modify `hosts.json`  
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates can be used to manage Azure resources, but they do not allow direct editing of the `host.json` file for a Function App, making it an unsuitable choice.

---

Question: Which of the following is a benefit of stateless design in cloud applications?

- [x] Stateless applications are easier to scale horizontally.
- [ ] Stateless applications are more secure because they don't use databases.
- [ ] Stateless applications are faster because they use less memory.
- [ ] Stateless applications are cheaper because they don't require any storage.

Answer: Stateless applications are easier to scale horizontally. Because each request is processed independently, you can easily add more instances of the application to handle more requests.

---

Question: You are developing a serverless function that needs to maintain some information between requests. What is a good way to manage this state?

- [ ] Store the state in a global variable in the function.
- [ ] Store the state in a cookie.
- [x] Store the state in a database or other external storage.
- [ ] Stateless functions cannot maintain state.

Answer: Store the state in a database or other external storage. Because serverless functions are stateless, they do not maintain any information between requests. To manage state, you can store it in an external storage system like a database.

---

Question: You are developing a web application that needs to maintain user sessions. The application is deployed on multiple servers for load balancing. What is a common issue you might encounter due to the stateless nature of HTTP, and how can it be addressed?

- [x] Users might lose their session data when their requests are handled by different servers. This can be addressed by implementing sticky sessions or by storing session data in a shared database.
- [ ] Users might not be able to make multiple requests at the same time. This can be addressed by implementing asynchronous request handling.
- [ ] Users might not be able to access the application if one of the servers goes down. This can be addressed by implementing a failover mechanism.
- [ ] Users might experience slow response times if the servers are located in different geographical locations. This can be addressed by implementing a content delivery network (CDN).

Answer: Users might lose their session data when their requests are handled by different servers. This can be addressed by implementing sticky sessions or by storing session data in a shared database.

---

Question: Your web application is deployed across multiple servers for load balancing. If one of the servers goes down, what strategy can be implemented to ensure high availability and prevent users from experiencing downtime?

- [ ] Implementing a Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- [ ] Implementing Sticky Sessions
- [x] Implementing a Failover Mechanism
- [ ] Implementing Asynchronous Request Handling

Answer: Implementing a Failover Mechanism. A failover mechanism can automatically redirect traffic to a backup server if the primary server fails, ensuring high availability.

---

Question: Which Azure Functions hosting plan is most suitable for always-on workloads that require full control over scaling rules and consistently allocated infrastructure resources?

- [x] Dedicated Plan
- [ ] Premium Plan
- [ ] Container Apps Plan

Answer: The Dedicated Plan runs on the Azure App Service Plan, which is ideal for always-on workloads, supports manual and rule-based autoscaling, and provides predictable resource allocation. It’s best when your functions are part of a larger app that’s running continuously and you want full control over the hosting environment.

---

Question: Which Azure Functions hosting plan is most suitable for always-on workloads that require event-driven auto-scaling?

- [ ] Dedicated Plan
- [x] Premium Plan
- [ ] Consumption Plan

Answer: Both Premium and Dedicated plans supports always-on workloads, but only Premium supports event-driven auto-scaling (Dedicated supports only manual or rule-based auto-scaling).

---

Question: What are the similarities and the differences between input and output binding? Give example for blob storage.

Answer: Both access an external storage object, the difference is input bindings read from it, while output write to it

- `Blob("samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}", FileAccess.Read)` is an input binding (`Read`)
- `Blob("samples-workitems/{queueTrigger}", FileAccess.Write)` is an output binding (`Write`)

---

Question: Write an Azure function that uses HTTP trigger and takes `id` from the url and `text` from request body, then appends the `text` to existing blob with id `id` and logs its new content. Use `Steam` for the blob.

```cs
[FunctionName("BlobAppend")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Code here
}
```

Answer:

```cs
[FunctionName("BlobAppend")]
public static void Run(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
    [Blob("{id}", FileAccess.ReadWrite)] Stream myBlob,

    ILogger log)
{
    var id = req.Query["id"];
    var requestBody = new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEnd();
    dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);

    // Read existing content from the blob
    var reader = new StreamReader(myBlob);
    var content = reader.ReadToEnd() + data?.text;
    var contentBytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(content);

    // Write to the blob
    myBlob.Write(contentBytes, 0, contentBytes.Length);
    myBlob.Position = 0;

    log.LogInformation($"Blob: {id}\n Content:{content} \n Size: {myBlob.Length} bytes");
}
```

Question: You're working for an e-commerce company that has high traffic and they're dealing with large amounts of customer orders. The company wants to keep a track of every order received in real-time and then send an automated confirmation email to the customer. Which Azure service would you choose to trigger your Azure function? Fill in the triggers and bindings in the following code:

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessOrder")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming order
    // Prepare an email message
    // Assign the message to the 'message' output binding to send email
}
```

Answer: In this case, the Azure function could be triggered by the Service Bus where each order corresponds to a message in a Service Bus Queue or Topic. The function could then use the SendGrid output binding to send a confirmation email to the customer.

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessOrder")]
public static void Run(
    [ServiceBusTrigger("<queue-name>", Connection = "ServiceBusConnectionString")]
    Order order,

    [SendGrid(ApiKey = "SendGridApiKey")]
    out SendGridMessage message,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming order
    // Prepare an email message
    // Assign the message to the 'message' output binding to send email
}
```

Question: You've been assigned a project where your task is to design an Azure function that activates automatically every 10 minutes. This function has to interact with a vast amount of unstructured data such as text or binary data from a source, perform necessary computations, and subsequently modify another source with the outcome. Now, in the context of this task, provide the appropriate triggers and bindings in the following code:

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessData")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Read data from input
    // Process the data
    // Write the processed data to output
}
```

Answer: To accomplish this, you could utilize a Timer Trigger for the Azure Function, enabling it to initiate every 10 minutes. This function could be configured with an input binding to retrieve data from the data source, in this case, Blob Storage, which is apt for handling unstructured data. Once the data processing is completed, an output binding to Blob Storage can be used to deposit the processed data.

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessData")]
public static void Run(
    [TimerTrigger("0 */10 * * * *")] TimerInfo myTimer,

    [Blob("<container-name>/<blob-name>", FileAccess.Read, Connection = "BlobStorageConnectionString")]
    Stream inputData,

    [Blob("<container-name>/<blob-name>", FileAccess.Write, Connection = "BlobStorageConnectionString")]
    Stream outputData,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Read data from input
    // Process the data
    // Write the processed data to output
}
```

Question: A company requires a function that can process incoming files automatically. They upload images regularly into a storage service, and they want those images to be resized automatically. Which Azure service could you use to trigger this function? Fill in the triggers and bindings in the following code:

```cs
[FunctionName("ResizeImage")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    string name,
    ILogger log)
{
    // Read the input image
    // Resize the image
    // Write the resized image to output image
}
```

Answer: This scenario is perfect for a Blob Storage trigger. The function could be triggered whenever a new blob (image) is added to the Blob Storage. Inside the function, you could use an image processing library to resize the images.

```cs
[FunctionName("ResizeImage")]
public static void Run(
    [BlobTrigger("<container-name>/{name}", Connection = "BlobStorageConnectionString")]
    Stream inputImage,

    [Blob("<container-name>/{name}", FileAccess.Write, Connection = "BlobStorageConnectionString")]
    Stream outputImage,

    string name,
    ILogger log)
{
    // Read the input image
    // Resize the image
    // Write the resized image to output image
}
```

Question: You are tasked with developing an Azure Function that will be triggered by Azure Blob storage. The function should only be triggered when `.jpg` files are added to a container named `images`. Which of the following filter criteria for `path` in the `function.json` file would meet the requirement?

- [ ] `images/jpg`
- [x] `images/{name}.jpg`
- [ ] `images/{name}/jpg`
- [ ] `images/*.jpg`
- [ ] `images/jpg/{name}`

Answer: The `{name}` is a placeholder that captures the blob name.  
`images/*.jpg` syntax is incorrect.

Question: Imagine you're devising a real-time analytics solution for a social media company. They desire to oversee and scrutinize user posts and reactions instantaneously. Your assignment is to develop an Azure function that is activated by this live activity. Considering the company's requirement for low-latency data access, complex querying, and globally distributed data, which Azure services would you utilize to accomplish this task? Please provide the triggers and bindings in the given code:

```cs
[FunctionName("AnalyzeUserActivity")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Loop over the events array
    // For each event, analyze the event data
    // Write the analysis results to globally distributed storage
}
```

Answer: Event Hubs would be a great choice for triggering the Azure function for real-time monitoring and analysis. Event Hubs are designed to capture streaming data like the one from social media feeds. After capturing this real-time data, it can then be processed using Azure Cosmos DB. Cosmos DB, a globally-distributed multi-model database service, would provide the required low-latency data access and support for handling large amounts of data, making it an excellent choice for processing this real-time data according to the company's requirements.

```cs
[FunctionName("AnalyzeUserActivity")]
public static void Run(
    [EventHubTrigger("<event-hub-name>", Connection = "EventHubConnectionString")]
    EventData[] events,

    [CosmosDB("<database-name>", "<collection-name>", ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnectionString")]
    out dynamic document,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Loop over the events array
    // For each event, analyze the event data
    // Write the analysis results to globally distributed storage
}
```

Question: You are responsible for creating a serverless application that communicates with an API. This application will ingest data through HTTP requests and, dependent on the received data, it must modify a structured NoSQL database in the cloud. This database should have a key/attribute store with a schemaless design. Could you outline how you would construct the Azure Function to fulfill this purpose? Please provide the triggers and bindings in the code below:

```cs
[FunctionName("UpdateDatabase")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Parse the incoming data
    // Add the processed data to storage
    // Return a success response
}
```

Answer: This is an example of an HTTP Trigger. The Azure function can be activated by an HTTP request containing the data. In response to the data received, the function could use an output binding to a structured NoSQL service, Azure Table Storage in this case, to modify the database accordingly.

```cs
[FunctionName("UpdateDatabase")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)]
    HttpRequest req,

    [Table("<table-name>", Connection = "<storage-connection-string>")]
    IAsyncCollector<dynamic> outputTable,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Parse the incoming data
    // Add the processed data to storage
    // Return a success response
}
```

Question: A logistics company wants to build a system that can handle incoming requests for package pickups and deliveries. They need a function that gets triggered every time a new pickup or delivery request is placed. The function should then push this information to a queue for further processing. How would you approach this requirement? Fill in the triggers and bindings in the following code:

```cs
[FunctionName("HandleDeliveryRequest")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming delivery request
    // Prepare the output request
    // The output request is automatically added to the queue
}
```

Answer: Queue Storage could be the trigger in this scenario. When a new pickup or delivery request is received, a new message could be added to a Queue Storage, which would trigger the function. The function could then perform necessary processing or further add the information to another queue for further processing.

```cs
[FunctionName("HandleDeliveryRequest")]
public static void Run(
    [QueueTrigger("<queue-name>", Connection = "StorageConnectionString")]
    DeliveryRequest deliveryRequest,

    [Queue("<output-queue-name>", Connection = "StorageConnectionString")]
    out DeliveryRequest outputRequest,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming delivery request
    // Prepare the output request
    // The output request is automatically added to the queue
}
```

Question: You are working on a project that requires automatic clean-up of older records in a database every day at a specific time. The clean-up task should be an Azure function that gets triggered at the specified time. The target database has high-throughput transactional capacity, and tunable consistency levels, can you delineate a solution for this task? Please provide the triggers and bindings in the given code.

```cs
[FunctionName("CleanUpOldRecords")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Loop over oldRecords
    // For each record, mark it for deletion or update it as per your logic
    // Add the updated records to database
}
```

Answer: A Timer trigger would be the optimal selection in this scenario. This allows for the scheduling of an Azure function to execute at a specified time each day. The function should utilize input and output bindings to Azure Cosmos DB, which provides specified capabilities. Its role would be to retrieve and clear out older records.

```cs
[FunctionName("CleanUpOldRecords")]
public static void Run(
    [TimerTrigger("0 0 * * *")] TimerInfo myTimer,

    [CosmosDB("<database-name>", "<collection-name>", ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnectionString", SqlQuery = "<SQL-query-for-old-records>")]
    IReadOnlyList<dynamic> oldRecords,

    [CosmosDB("<database-name>", "<collection-name>", ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnectionString")]
    IAsyncCollector<dynamic> outputDocuments,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Loop over oldRecords
    // For each record, mark it for deletion or update it as per your logic
    // Add the updated records to database
}
```

Question: Let's consider a case where you're dealing with an IoT project. You're receiving huge amounts of telemetry data from IoT devices, and this data should trigger an Azure function that analyses the data in near real-time. Assuming you would need a service that can handle vast amounts of data with millisecond response times, storage should provide low latency at any scale. How would you structure the Azure function for this situation? Please provide the triggers and bindings in the given code.

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessTelemetryData")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Loop over the events array
    // For each event, process the telemetry data
    // Write the processed data to storage
}
```

Answer: Event Hubs would again be the right choice for this scenario, given their capability to handle large amounts of data in real-time. The telemetry data could be sent to an Event Hub, which would trigger the function. The function could then analyze the data and use an output binding to store the analysis results. Cosmos DB's capabilities to provide low latency at any scale and its global distribution n

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessTelemetryData")]
public static void Run(
    [EventHubTrigger("<event-hub-name>", Connection = "EventHubConnectionString")]
    EventData[] events,

    [CosmosDB("<database-name>", "<collection-name>", ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnectionString")]
    out dynamic document,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Loop over the events array
    // For each event, process the telemetry data
    // Write the processed data to storage
}
```

Question: A media company requires an Azure function to accumulate real-time news data from various online sources (webhooks) and subsequently deposit the collected data in a particular format into a database. Given the need to store large amounts of unstructured data that will be accessed infrequently, what approach would you suggest? Please provide the triggers and bindings in the provided code:

```cs
[FunctionName("CollectNewsData")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Parse the incoming data
    // Process the news data, if necessary
    // Add the news data to storage
    // Return a success response
}
```

Answer: To gather real-time news data from diverse web sources, an HTTP trigger could be utilized. The function could then reformat the amassed data and employ an output binding to a service that specializes in storing large amounts of unstructured data and is cost-effective for infrequent data access - Azure Blob Storage - to deposit the data.

```cs
[FunctionName("CollectNewsData")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(

Question: In a microservice architecture, you have an Azure function that needs to send messages to multiple subscribers. The subscribers then process these messages in their own time. How would you design this system? Fill in the triggers and bindings in the following code:

```cs
[FunctionName("BroadcastMessage")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming message, if necessary
    // Prepare the output message
    // The output message is automatically sent for the subscribers to read later
}
```

Answer: In this microservice architecture, the Azure function could use the Service Bus topic to send messages to multiple subscribers. Each subscriber could listen to the topic and process the message in their own time. This way, the Azure function doesn't need to know about the subscribers and the subscribers can process messages independently.

```cs
[FunctionName("BroadcastMessage")]
public static void Run(
    [ServiceBusTrigger("<topic-name>", "<subscription-name>", Connection = "ServiceBusConnectionString")]
    Message inputMessage,

    [ServiceBus("<output-topic-name>", Connection = "ServiceBusConnectionString")]
    out Message outputMessage,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming message, if necessary
    // Prepare the output message
    // The output message is automatically sent for the subscribers to read later
}
```

Question: Imagine you're part of an organization that operates in the cloud and manages numerous resources across a wide variety of Azure subscriptions. For compliance and auditing purposes, the company aims to log all changes to resource states. Considering that your organization operates worldwide, requiring the data to be available without significant latency regardless of the location, which Azure service would you recommend to trigger your Azure Function? Fill in the triggers and bindings in the code provided:

```cs
[FunctionName("LogResourceChanges")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming event
    // Prepare the document based on the event data
    // The document is automatically added to storage
}
```

Answer: For this scenario, an Event Grid trigger would be ideal. Azure Event Grid is capable of dispatching an event whenever there is a state change in Azure resources, which in turn triggers your Azure Function. Following activation, the function could log these changes to a data service that can offer seamless access to data from any corner of the world, such as Azure Cosmos DB, using an output binding. This would ensure that no matter where the request is coming from, data access will remain consistent and fast, supporting your global operations.

```cs
[FunctionName("LogResourceChanges")]
public static void Run(
    [EventGridTrigger]
    EventGridEvent eventGridEvent,

    [CosmosDB("<database-name>", "<collection-name>", ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnectionString")]
    out dynamic document,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming event
    // Prepare the document based on the event data
    // The document is automatically added to storage
}
```

Question: You've been tasked with developing a system to handle real-time reactions to blog posts on a website. The system needs to notify all registered users whenever a new blog post is published. What Azure services would you recommend to set up the Azure function? Fill in the triggers and bindings in the following code:

```cs
[FunctionName("NotifyUsers")]
public static async void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming event
    // Prepare the notification based on the blog post data
    // Use HttpClient to send the notification to all registered users
}
```

Answer: For real-time notifications, you could use an Event Grid trigger. When a new blog post is published, it can trigger an event which in turn triggers the Azure function. The function could then use an output binding to a Service Bus topic to notify all registered users.

```cs
[FunctionName("NotifyUsers")]
public static async void Run(
    [EventGridTrigger]
    EventGridEvent eventGridEvent,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the incoming event
    // Prepare the notification based on the blog post data
    // Use HttpClient to send the notification to all registered users
}
```

Question: A customer is keen on setting up a system that is capable of accepting JSON payloads from an assortment of services. This payload data is then intended to be stored in a database that is optimal for storing large amounts of structured, non-relational data, such as metadata, user data, and diagnostic data. How would you structure an Azure Function to accommodate this need? Please provide the triggers and bindings in the following code.

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessPayload")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process incoming JSON payload data
    // Add the processed data to designated storage
    // Return a success response
}
```

Answer: In this circumstance, an HTTP trigger could be employed to receive the JSON payloads. The payload data could then be stored into a database service that is designed for storing structured NoSQL data using an output binding - in this case, Azure Table Storage.

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessPayload")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
    [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)]
    HttpRequest req,

    [Table("<table-name>", Connection = "StorageConnectionAppSetting")]
    IAsyncCollector<dynamic> outputTable,

    ILogger log)
{
    // Process incoming JSON payload data
    // Add the processed data to designated storage
    // Return a success response
}
```

Question: How to define an HTTP output binding in Azure Function?

- [ ] Using `[Http(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "post", Route = null)]` parameter
- [x] Returning `Task<IActionResult>` result from the function
- [ ] There is only HTTP input binding, output binding does not exist

Answer: This binding requires an HTTP trigger and allows you to customize the response associated with the trigger's request.

Question: Write an Azure function that is invoked when there are inserts or updates in the `Items` collection of `ToDoItems` database for Cosmos DB.

```cs
[FunctionName("CosmosTrigger")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    ILogger log)
{
    // TODO: List modified documents
}
```

Answer:

```cs
[FunctionName("CosmosTrigger")]
public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
    [CosmosDBTrigger(databaseName: "ToDoItems", collectionName: "Items", ConnectionStringSetting = "CosmosDBConnection",LeaseCollectionName = "leases", CreateLeaseCollectionIfNotExists = true)]
    IReadOnlyList<Document> documents,

    ILogger log)
{
    if (documents != null && documents.Count > 0)
    {
        log.LogInformation($"Documents modified: {documents.Count}");
        for (var i = 0; i < documents.Count; i++)
            log.LogInformation($"First document Id: {documents[0].Id}");
    }
}
```

Question: You're part of a large digital library that digitizes and stores thousands of books. Once a book is digitized and stored in Blob Storage, a process is triggered to generate metadata for the digitized book. After the metadata is generated, an event should be fired to notify other services for further processing (e.g., updating the search index, notifying users who requested this book). How would you set up the Azure function to handle this situation?

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessDigitizedBook")]
public static void Run(
    /* Triggers and Bindings here */

    string name,
    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the inputBook to generate metadata
    // Prepare an EventGridEvent with the metadata
    // Add the event to the 'outputEvents' output binding, which will send it to Event Grid
}
```

Answer:

```cs
[FunctionName("ProcessDigitizedBook")]
public static void Run(
    [BlobTrigger("<container-name>/{name}", Connection = "BlobStorageConnectionString")]
    Stream inputBook,

    [EventGrid(TopicEndpointUri = "<topic-endpoint>", TopicKeySetting = "<topic-key>")]
    ICollector<EventGridEvent> outputEvents,

    string name,
    ILogger log)
{
    // Process the inputBook to generate metadata
    var metadata = GenerateMetadata(inputBook);

    // Prepare an EventGridEvent with the metadata
    var event = new EventGridEvent("/subject/path", "Book.Digitized", "1.0", metadata);

    // Send the event
    await outputEvents.AddAsync(event);

    log.LogInformation($"Processed blob\n Name:{name} \n Size: {inputBook.Length} Bytes");
}
```

Question: Write a cron schedule expression that will execute a command every 30th minute of every two hours, for the first 15 days of the summer months (June, July, and August), on weekdays (Monday through Friday).

Answer: 30 \*/2 1-15 6-8 1-5

---

Question: You need to create an Azure Function that is triggered every 5 minutes. Which of the following cron schedules can be used?

- [x] `0 */5 * * * *`
- [x] `*/5 * * * *`
- [ ] `*/5 * * * * *`
- [ ] `* */5 * * *`
- [ ] `0 5 * * * *`
- [ ] `5 * * * *`
- [ ] `5 * * * * *`
- [ ] `* 5 * * *`

Answer: Cron schedules supports both 5 and 6 fields (`{minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}` or `{second} {minute} {hour} {day} {month} {day-of-week}`). To make them run at every 5 minutes, `*/5` is used.

Question: In your e-commerce system, you've built two Azure Functions to handle order processing and retrieval. The `OrderProcessingFunction` is triggered when an order is placed by a customer via an Azure Service Bus queue. The details of this order are then processed and stored into a cloud storage system for later reference. Configuration for the service is stored into Cosmos DB database. The `OrderRetrievalFunction` is invoked on-demand via a web request, which fetches and returns the previously stored order details.

Which triggers and bindings would you use in the `OrderProcessingFunction`?

- [x] ServiceBus trigger binding
- [ ] HTTP trigger binding
- [ ] Blob trigger binding
- [ ] Cosmos DB trigger binding
- [ ] Blob input binding
- [x] Blob output binding
- [ ] Blob input/output binding
- [x] Cosmos DB input binding
- [ ] Cosmos DB output binding
- [ ] Cosmos DB input/output binding

Answer: The `OrderProcessingFunction` uses the ServiceBus trigger binding because it is triggered by new messages (orders) arriving in the Azure Service Bus. Configuration for the service is stored in a Cosmos DB database, so a Cosmos DB input binding is required. Function uses the Blob output binding to store the processed order details into Azure Blob Storage, a cloud storage system.

Question: You're working on a collection of Azure Functions and have recently deployed a new Function App that runs on .Net Core 3.1. Where would you specify the logging settings for these Azure Functions?

- [ ] `local.function.json`
- [ ] `function.json`
- [x] `host.json`
- [ ] `app.json`
- [ ] `appsettings.json`

Answer: The logging configurations for Azure Functions are set in the `host.json` file.

Question: You have an Azure Function set up in your Azure account. This Function pulls data from an Azure Storage Queue and deposits it into an Azure SQL Database. Sometimes, the function fails and shows a "Timeout expired" error. This could be because the connection pool has reached its limit. How can you address this problem?

- [x] Tweak the batchSize value in the `host.json` file
- [ ] Adjust the `queueMax` setting in the function.json file
- [ ] Switch to a Timer-based trigger
- [ ] Upgrade to a Premium-tier App Service Plan

Answer: The root cause could be the function running too many tasks at once, using up all the available database connections. You can either expand the database's connection pool or alter the batchSize parameter in the host.json file to limit concurrent function runs.

Questions: It’s Christmas at Grandma’s, and just as you’re savoring your third glass of wine, work calls with an “urgent” issue. Instead of launching into full-blown tech mode, you decide to cobble together an Azure Function - because nothing says “holiday spirit” like a little on-the-fly coding. What’s your go-to approach for resolving this with minimal fuss?

- [ ] Use you poor grandma's Pentium II computer.
- [x] Use your phone's browser.
- [ ] Install vim.
- [ ] Install bunch of SDKs.
- [x] Choose `C# Script` because you are drunk.
- [ ] Choose `Java` because you are REALLY drunk.
- [ ] Create `host.json` file.
- [x] Create `function.json`.
- [ ] None of these is applicable, you have to go back to the office and break everyone's hearts.

Answer: You can use your phone to access Azure Portal. Languages like `C# Script`, `JavaScript`, `Python`, `PowerShell` are natively supported for editing in the portal. Because you use a scripting language, you must also create `function.json`.

- Grandma’s ancient computer? Probably best left for playing solitaire.
- Installing an SDK and editor on that dinosaur will be akin to climbing Everest with slippers on.
- If you choose Java, you have to use an editor, thus a computer - not the best option here.
